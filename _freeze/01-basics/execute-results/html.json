You need both components for this course.\n\nIf this is not ringing any bells yet, have a quick browse through the [materials from year 1](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#sec-intro-r){target=\"_blank\"}to refresh yopur memory.\n\n### R server\n\nR and RStudio are already installed on the *R server*. We recommend using the server if your computer does not allow installation (e.g., a Chromebook), or if you have problems with installing R on your computer. Otherwise, you should consider installing R and RStudio on your own computer.\n\nYou will find the link to the server on Moodle.\n\n### Installing R and RStudio on your computer\n\n@sec-installing-r has detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your own computer. There are also some links to a series of walkthroughs for installing R on different types of computers/ operating systems.\n\nIf you had R and RStudio installed on your own computer last year, we recommend updating to the latest versions. In fact, it might be good to do that at the start of each academic year. Detailed guidance can be found in @sec-updating-r.\n\nOnce you have installed/updated R and RStudio, come back to this chapter.\n\n### Settings for Reproducibility\n\n*--> mention the replication crisis, findings are not reproducible. Hence it's super important that we do things in a reproducible way*\n\n*Wikipedia: The replication crisis[a] is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method,[2] such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge.*\n\n\nYou should be doing things reproducibly, so that others (and your future self) can understand and check your work. That also allows you to reuse your work more easily.\n\nYou should always start with a clear workspace. Keeping anything in your Environment from a previous session means you can never be sure whether your current code is working or if your code is accessing a previously created object.\n\nHence, there are a few settings you should fix immediately after installing/updating RStudio, in <if>Tools \\> Global Options... General tab</if>\n\n-   uncheck the box that says <if>Restore .RData into workspace at startup</if> to make sure no data from a previous session is loaded into the environment\n-   set <if>Save workspace to .RData on exit</if> to <if>Never</if> so that your workspace is not saved when you exit RStudio.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Reproducibility settings](images/rstudio_settings_reproducibility.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RStudio panes\n\nRStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:\n\n-   Source pane\n-   Environment pane\n-   Console pane\n-   Output pane\n\n**Do you remember what their purpose is?**\n\n**The Source pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_BICJPFEXUQ'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_BICJPFEXUQ\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_BICJPFEXUQ\" value=\"\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_BICJPFEXUQ\" value=\"\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_BICJPFEXUQ\" value=\"\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**The Environment pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_FBFZOPGAYB'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FBFZOPGAYB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FBFZOPGAYB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FBFZOPGAYB\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FBFZOPGAYB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**The Console pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_ORZDHANNFR'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_ORZDHANNFR\" value=\"\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_ORZDHANNFR\" value=\"\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_ORZDHANNFR\" value=\"\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_ORZDHANNFR\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**The Output pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_DOKDKVTBNT'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DOKDKVTBNT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DOKDKVTBNT\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DOKDKVTBNT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DOKDKVTBNT\" value=\"\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**Where are these panes located by default?**\n\n-   The Source pane is located?

It makes life easier to work in multiple contexts, for example when analysing different datasets at the same time. Every RStudio project has their folder location, workspace, and working directories, basically keeping all the data and the RMarkdown documents in one location.\n\nLast year, you learnt how to create projects on the server, so you already know the steps. If cannot quite recall how that was done, go back to the [Level 1 materials](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#new-project){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nOn your own computer, open RStudio, and complete the following steps in this order:\n\n-   Click on <if>File \\> New Project...</if>\n-   Then, click on \"New Directory\"\n-   Then, click on \"New Project\"\n-   Name the directory something useful (e.g., \"2A_chapter1\"), and save it in a location that makes sense, for example a dedicated folder you have for your level 2 Psychology labs - you can either select a folder you have already in place, or create a new one (e.g., I named my new folder \"Level 2 labs\")\n-   Click \"Create Project\". RStudio will restart itself and open with this new project directory as the working directory.\n-   You can also check in your folder structure that everything was created as intended\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Creating a new project](images/project_setup.gif){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Why is the Colour scheme in the gif different?\" collapse=\"true\"}\nIn case anyone is wondering why my colour scheme in the gif above looks different to yours, I've set mine to \"Pastel On Dark\" in <if>Tools \\> Global Options... \\> Appearances</if>. And my computer lives in \"dark mode\".\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n## Don't nest projects\n\nDon't ever save a new project **inside** another project directory.

The paper was published earlier this year, and the original data can be found on OSF ([https://osf.io/4jac7/](https://osf.io/4jac7/){target=\"_blank\"}). However, for the purpose of this chapter, I have modified the data slightly (for example, using a file format you can work with). \n\n**citation**\nPownall, M., & Heflick, N. (2024). Male psychologists and female mathematicians: Gender beliefs and undergraduate degree choices. *Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology, 34*(2), e2784. [https://doi.org/10.1002/casp.2784](https://doi.org/10.1002/casp.2784){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n**Abstract**\nGlobally, men and women are numerically dominant in undergraduate degrees in math and psychology, respectively. A variety of theoretical perspectives predict that individuals who adhere more to gender stereotypes will be more represented in gender-dominant fields. Using a pre-registered methodology, we recruited men and women enrolled in psychology and math degree programmes in the United Kingdom and assessed a variety of gender beliefs and identities. Overall, femininity was (marginally) higher in psychology, and higher amongst women generally. Moderated regression analyses revealed that women who were low in masculinity and high in femininity (the stereotypical pattern) were most likely to be in psychology degrees, whilst women who were low in both were most likely to be enrolled onto math programmes. For men, no component of gender identity or beliefs predicted degree programmes. Overall, these results demonstrate how dimensions of gender identity may account for gender differences in undergraduate representation. Specifically, women in STEM fields tend to not describe themselves in stereotypical masculine or feminine traits. We discuss implications for efforts to increase uptake of gender stereotype incongruent career paths (e.g., women in STEM) with a particular focus on how femininity may be rejected in counter-stereotypical domains.\n\n## R Markdown basics\n\n### Creating an R Markdown file\n\ndelete everything after the knitting part from line 12\n\nand save it in the project.
