You need both components for this course.\n\nIf this is not ringing any bells yet, have a quick browse through the [materials from year 1](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#sec-intro-r){target=\"_blank\"} to refresh your memory.\n\n### R server\n\nR and RStudio are already installed on the *R server*. We recommend using the server if your computer does not allow installation (e.g., a Chromebook), or if you have problems installing R on your computer. Otherwise, you should consider installing R and RStudio on your own computer.\n\nYou will find the link to the server on Moodle.\n\n### Installing R and RStudio on your computer\n\n@sec-installing-r has detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your own computer. There are also some links to a series of walkthroughs for installing R on different types of computers/ operating systems.\n\nIf you had R and RStudio installed on your own computer last year, we recommend updating to the latest versions. In fact, it might be good to do that at the start of each academic year. Detailed guidance can be found in @sec-updating-r.\n\nOnce you have installed/updated R and RStudio, come back to this chapter.\n\n### Settings for Reproducibility\n\nBy now you should be aware that the Psychology department at the University of Glasgow is pretty big on reproducibility, open science, and raising awareness about questionable research practices (QRPs). Therefore, you should be doing things reproducibly so that others (and your future self) can understand and check your work. That also allows you to reuse your work more easily.\n\nAlways start with a clear workspace. Keeping anything in your `Global Environment` from a previous session means you can never be sure whether your current code is working or if your code is accessing previously created objects.\n\nHence, there are a few settings you should fix immediately after installing/updating RStudio, in <if>Tools \\> Global Options... General tab</if>\n\n-   uncheck the box that says <if>Restore .RData into workspace at startup</if> to make sure no data from a previous session is loaded into the environment\n-   set <if>Save workspace to .RData on exit</if> to <if>Never</if> so that your workspace is not saved when you exit RStudio.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Reproducibility settings](images/rstudio_settings_reproducibility.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RStudio panes\n\nRStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:\n\n-   Source pane\n-   Environment pane\n-   Console pane\n-   Output pane\n\nLet's see what you remember about the RStudio panes from last year.

If you want to know more about them, there is the [RStudio guide on posit](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Activity 1: Creating a new project\n\nIt's important that we create a new RStudio project every time we start a new project. It makes life easier to work in multiple contexts, for example when analysing different datasets at the same time. Every RStudio project has their folder location, workspace, and working directories, basically keeping all the data and the RMarkdown documents in one location.\n\nLast year, you learnt how to create projects on the server, so you already know the steps. If cannot quite recall how that was done, go back to the [Level 1 materials](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#new-project){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nOn your own computer, open RStudio, and complete the following steps in this order:\n\n-   Click on <if>File \\> New Project...</if>\n-   Then, click on \"New Directory\"\n-   Then, click on \"New Project\"\n-   Name the directory something meaningful (e.g., \"2A_chapter1\"), and save it in a location that makes sense, for example, a dedicated folder you have for your level 2 Psychology labs - you can either select a folder you have already in place, or create a new one (e.g., I named my new folder \"Level 2 labs\")\n-   Click \"Create Project\". RStudio will restart itself and open with this new project directory as the working directory. If you accidentally close it, you can open it by double-clicking on the project icon in your folder\n-   You can also check in your folder structure that everything was created as intended\n\n![Creating a new project](images/project_setup.gif)\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Why is the Colour scheme in the gif different?\" collapse=\"true\"}\nIn case anyone is wondering why my colour scheme in the gif above looks different to yours, I've set mine to \"Pastel On Dark\" in <if>Tools \\> Global Options... \\> Appearances</if>. And my computer lives in \"dark mode\".\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n## Don't nest projects\n\nDon't ever save a new project **inside** another project directory. This can cause some hard-to-resolve problems.\n:::\n\n## Activity 2: Create a new R Markdown file\n\n-   Open a new R Markdown document: click <if>File \\> New File \\> R Markdown</if> or click on the little page icon with a green plus sign (top left).\n-   Give it a meaningful `Title` (e.g., Level 2 chapter 1) - you can also change the title later. Feel free to add your name or GUID in the `Author` field author name. Keep the `Default Output Format` as HTML.\n-   Once the Rmd opened, you need to save the file.\n-   To save it, click <if>File \\> Save As...</if> or click on the little disc icon. Name it something meaningful (e.g., \"chapter_01.Rmd\", \"01_intro.Rmd\"). Make sure there are no spaces in the name - R is not very fond of spaces... This file will automatically be saved in your project folder (i.e., your working directory) so you should now see this file appear in your file viewer pane.\n\n\n\n![Creating a new Rmd file](images/Rmd_setup.gif)\n\nRemember, an R Markdown document or Rmd has \"white space\" (i.e., the markdown for formatted text) and \"grey parts\" (i.e., code chunks) in the default colour scheme (see @fig-rmd), and is a great way to create dynamic documents. The key advantage of R Markdown is that it allows you to write code into a document, along with regular text, and then **knit** it using the package `knitr()` to create your document as either a webpage (HTML), a PDF, or Word document (.docx). We'll only knit to html documents in this course.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Default Rmd with highlighting - names in pink and XXX in purple](images/default_highlighted.png){#fig-rmd fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Markdown\n\nThe markdown space is for formatted text. You can and should write notes for yourself and others on what your code is doing (earlier on) or what decisions you are making. This can be really useful later on, for example, when making decision about inclusion/exclusion criteria or whatever you conclude from your assumption tests.\n\nThere is a variety of **heading levels** to make use of, using the # symbol. You would incorporate this into your text as:\n\n\\# Heading level 1\n\n\\## Heading level 2\n\n\\### Heading level 3\n\n\\#### Heading level 4\n\n\\##### Heading level 5\n\n\\###### Heading level 6\n\n\nAnd it will be displayed in your knitted html file as \n\n::: {.small_right}\n![](images/heading_levels.PNG)\n:::\n\nYou can also include **bullet points** using either `*`, `-` or `+` and they will turn into:\n\n* bullet point created with `*`\n- bullet point created with `-`\n+ bullet point created with `+`\n\n\nor use bullet points of different levels using 2 spaces (for sub-item 1) or 4 spaces for (sub-item 2):\n\n* bullet point item\n  * sub-item 1\n    * sub-item 2\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## My bullet points don't work when knitting\n\nYou need an empty row before your bullet points start. If I delete the empty row before the bullet points, they will be displayed in the html as ...\n\nText without the empty row:\n* bullet point created with `*`\n- bullet point created with `-`\n+ bullet point created with `+`\n\n:::\n\nInclude **emphasis** to display text in **bold** or *italics* etc.\n\n|R markdown syntax  | Displayed in the knitted html file |\n|:----------------- |:-----------------------------------|\n| \\**bold text**    | **bold text**                      |\n| \\*italic text*    | *italic text*                      |\n\n\nOther examples can be found in the [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Code chunks\n\nEverything you write into the **code chunks** will be interpreted as code and computed by R. Code chunks start with ` ``` ` followed by an `{r}` which specifies the coding language, some space for code, and ends with ` ``` `. If you accidentally delete one of those backticks, your code won't run and/or your text parts will be interpreted as part of the code chunks or vice versa. This should be evident from the colour change - more white than expected if it's one of the starting backticks, and too much grey/not enough white when it's the backticks at the end. But no need to fret - just add the missing backticks manually.\n\nYou can **insert a new code chunk** either by\n\n* clicking the `Insert a new code chunk` button in the RStudio Toolbar (green icon at the top right corner of the `Source pane`)\n* clicking on the menu <if>Code \\> Insert Chunk</if>\n* using the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + I` for Windows and `Cmd + Option + I` on MacOSX or\n* typing ` ```{r}` and ` ``` ` manually\n\n\nWithin the curly brackets, you can **specify a name** for your code chunk (see pink highlighting in @fig-rmd). The chunk name is not necessarily required, however, it is good practice to give each chunk a unique name to support more advanced knitting approaches.\n\nWithin the the curly brackets, you can also place rules and arguments (see purple highlighting in @fig-rmd) to give you control over how your code is interpreted and what exactly is shown in your html output. The most common **knitr display options** are:\n\n\n| Code                | Does code run | Does code show | Do results show |\n|:--------------------|:--------------|:---------------|:----------------|\n| eval=FALSE          | NO            | YES            | NO              |\n| echo=TRUE (default) | YES           | YES            | YES             |\n| echo=FALSE          | YES           | NO             | YES             |\n| results=\"hide\"      | YES           | YES            | NO              |\n| include=FALSE       | YES           | NO             | NO              |\n\n\n\nThere are also the options of manipulating messages and warnings in the knitted document:\n\n-   `message=FALSE` will not display any messages generated by the code, and\n-   `warning=FALSE` will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n::: callout-important\nThe table above will be incredibly important for the data skills homework II.\n:::\n\n\n-   In your newly created Rmd file, delete everything below line 12 (keep the set-up code chunk) and save your Rmd by clicking on the disc symbol.\n\n![Delete everything below line 12](images/delete_12.gif)\n\n\n\n## Activity 3: The data for this chapter\n\nThe data . Download it here: [filename](data/data_ch1.zip \"download\"). There are 2 csv files contained in a zip-folder. One is the data file we are going to use today `hp_data_modified.csv` and the other is the `questionnaire_codebook` for the main 3 questionnaires used in the data.\n\nFirst step is to unzip that folder so that the files are placed within the same folder as your project.\n\n[Include a screenshot here once we have data]()\n\nThe paper was published in 2023, and the original data can be found on OSF ([https://osf.io/5qshg/](https://osf.io/5qshg/){target=\"_blank\"}). However, for the purpose of this chapter, we have modified the data slightly (e.g., recoding some variables etc.).\n\n**Citation**\n\n> Pownall, M., Pennington, C.

Evaluating the Pedagogical Effectiveness of Study Preregistration in the Undergraduate Dissertation. *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 6*(4). [https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459231202724](https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459231202724){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n**Abstract**\n\n> Research shows that questionable research practices (QRPs) are present in undergraduate final-year dissertation projects. One entry-level Open Science practice proposed to mitigate QRPs is “study preregistration,” through which researchers outline their research questions, design, method, and analysis plans before data collection and/or analysis. In this study, we aimed to empirically test the effectiveness of preregistration as a pedagogic tool in undergraduate dissertations using a quasi-experimental design. A total of 89 UK psychology students were recruited, including students who preregistered their empirical quantitative dissertation (*n* = 52; experimental group) and students who did not (*n* = 37; control group). Attitudes toward statistics, acceptance of QRPs, and perceived understanding of Open Science were measured both before and after dissertation completion. Exploratory measures included capability, opportunity, and motivation to engage with preregistration, measured at Time 1 only. This study was conducted as a Registered Report; Stage 1 protocol: https://osf.io/9hjbw (date of in-principle acceptance: September 21, 2021). Study preregistration did not significantly affect attitudes toward statistics or acceptance of QRPs. However, students who preregistered reported greater perceived understanding of Open Science concepts from Time 1 to Time 2 compared with students who did not preregister. Exploratory analyses indicated that students who preregistered reported significantly greater capability, opportunity, and motivation to preregister. Qualitative responses revealed that preregistration was perceived to improve clarity and organization of the dissertation, prevent QRPs, and promote rigor. Disadvantages and barriers included time, perceived rigidity, and need for training. These results contribute to discussions surrounding embedding Open Science principles into research training.\n\n## Activity 4: Loading packages and reading in data\n\nThe first step is to load in the packages that we need, and read in the data\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_os <- read_csv(\"data/anon_data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 214 Columns: 104\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (15): id, gender, gender_text, ug_degree_subject, pg_degree_subject, phd...\ndbl (89): qt_progress, qt_duration_sec, age, degree_ug, degree_pg, degree_ot...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Activity 5: Familiarise yourself with the data\n\nStep 1: check the codebook (not sure whether to have them look at the variables in the codebook or list some of them here).\n\nBefore you dive into wrangling the data, you need to get an understanding of what kind of data you are dealing with and what the format of the dataframe looks like.\n\nAs you may have noticed, `read_csv()` gives you a **message** what data types appear in your dataset and how many of the columns are in that format. It only lists a few examples of the, so it's not super useful when you want some specific information. However, it does tell you how many rows and columns your dataframe has.\n\nBut there are a few other ways you can get more detailed information about your data. Use whichever method you prefer but do it. Click on the individual tabs to look at the different options:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## visual inspection\n\nYou can click on the blue arrow icon next to the object name in the `Global Environment`. This will expand and show information about your columns. The `$` indicates a column (from BaseR).\n\n\\[include a screenshot with a circle around the arrow\\]\n\n## glimpse()\n\nUse `glimpse()` if you want a more detailed overview you can see on your screen. The output will display rows and column numbers, and some examples of the first couple of observations for each variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r

Doubles can have decimal places (e.g., 1.1). Integers are the whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, -1) and are displayed with the suffix L (e.g., 1L). This is not overly important but might leave you less puzzled the next time you see an L after a number.\n\n**Characters** (also called “strings”) is anything written between quotation marks. This is usually text, but in special circumstances, a number can be a character if it placed within quotation marks. This can happen when you are recoding variables. It might not be too obvious at the time, but you won't be able to calculate anything if the number is a character\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Example data types\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(1)\ntypeof(1L)\ntypeof(\"1\")\ntypeof(\"text\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"double\"\n[1] \"integer\"\n[1] \"character\"\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## numeric computation\n\nNo problems here...\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1+1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## character computation\n\nWhen the data type is incorrect, you won't be able to compute anything, despite your numbers being shown as numeric values in the dataframe.

They become really important when we use `filter()` (see @sec-filter) or `mutate()` with conditional statements such as `case_when()` (see @sec-conditional).\n\nSome commonly used logical operators:\n\n| operator | description                                    |\n|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------|\n| \\>       | greater than                                   |\n| \\>=      | greater than or equal to                       |\n| \\<       | less than                                      |\n| \\<=      | less than or equal to                          |\n| ==       | equal to                                       |\n| !=       | not equal to                                   |\n| %in%     | TRUE if any element is in the following vector |\n\nA **factor** is a specific type of integer or character that lets you assign the order of the categories. This becomes useful when you want to display certain categories in \"the correct order\" either in a dataframe (see *arrange*) or when plotting (see @sec-dataviz).\n\n### Variable types\n\nYou've already encountered them in [Level 1](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/intro-to-probability.html){target=\"_blank\"}. Variables can be classified as **continuous** (numbers) or **categorical** (labels). It's good to know the distinctions as it will help to decide the appropriate plot for your data (see @sec-appropriate-plot).\n\n**Categorical** variables are properties you can count. They can be **nominal**, where the categories don't have an order (e.g., gender) or **ordinal** (e.g., Likert scales either with numeric values 1-7 or with character labels such as \"agree\", \"neither agree nor disagree\", \"disagree\"). Categorical data may also be **factors** rather than characters.\n\n**Continuous variables** are properties you can measure and calculate sums/ means/ etc. They may be rounded to the nearest whole number, but it should make sense to have a value between them. Continuous variables always have a **numeric** data type (i.e. `integer` or `double`).\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Test your understanding\n\nLet’s have a closer look at our data `data_os`.

this important you may ask\n\nData is messy, especially in a raw format (i.e., when you download it straight from your testing software). R prefers the data to be tidy, which means each row is an **observation**, each column is a **variable**, and the information in each cell is a single **value**.\n\nI've modified the data for today slightly, to build in some challenges that you would experience when dealing with raw data, but tbh, the data we are looking at today is pretty tidy.\n\nGetting an understanding of what your data currently looks like and being aware of what your data structure needs to be (e.g., for calculating descriptives, running inferential stats or plotting) is the first step of thinking about the processing steps of how to get your data from A to B.\n\n## Data Wrangling\n\nThe basic ones are the **Wickham 6** that you've encountered already last year\n\ntable of the Wickham 6 refer them back to the different chapters where they encountered it in level 1\n\n| Function    | Description                                                | First introduced in Level 1 Chapter                                                                                               |\n|:-----------------|:----------------------------------|:------------------|\n| select()    | Include or exclude certain variables (columns)             | [Chapter 6.5](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/corsi-blocks-2.html#activity-3-selecting-variables){target=\"_blank\"}     |\n| filter()    | Include or exclude certain observations/data (rows)        | [Chapter 6.6](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/corsi-blocks-2.html#activity-4-filtering-observations){target=\"_blank\"}  |\n| mutate()    | Creates new variables (columns)                            | [Chapter 8.8](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/belonging-2.html?q=mutate#activity-5-mutate-and-recode){target=\"_blank\"} |\n| arrange()   | Changes the order of observations (rows)                   | not yet introduced                                                                                                                |\n| group_by()  | Organises the observations (rows) into groups              | [Chapter 3.5.3](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/stroop-2.html#summarising-by-groups){target=\"_blank\"}                  |\n| summarise() | Create summary variables for groups of observations (rows) | [Chapter 3.5.2](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/stroop-2.html#calculating-summary-statistics){target=\"_blank\"}         |\n\n### Brief recap of the Wickham 6\n\n#### select\n\nMassive dataframes use a lot of computing power - to reduce that, it would be worth focussing on the columns you need\n\nselecting variables - you can rename them too if you don't like the column name as is\n\nif you wanna rename something at a later stage, use rename. Works in the same manner as select as in new name = old name. --\\> This could be in an information box\n\ndeselecting deselecting multiple variables\n\n#### filter\n\ntext - one condition vs more than one condition numbers - smaller/ larger\n\n#### arrange\n\nascending, descending - NAs will always listed at the end regardless\n\nfactors - sorting data in a preferred way\n\n#### mutate\n\nAllison's drawing\n\n#### group_by & summarise\n\n## Tidy data\n\ncopied from Lisa\n\n## Data types and what are observations/ variables\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Do not factor numbers\n\nIf you factor numeric data, it gets converted to the integers 1 to the number of unique values, no matter what the values are. Additionally, you can no longer use the values as numbers, such as calculating the mean.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" filename='Example'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(-3, 0, .5)  # numeric vector\nf <- factor(x)     # convert to factor\nx == as.numeric(f) # does not convert back to numeric \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" filename='You cannot average a factor'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm <- mean(f)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in mean.default(f): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nSometimes people represent categorical variables with numbers that correspond to names, like 0 = \"no\" and 1 = \"yes\", but values in between don't have a clear interpretation. If you have control over how the data are recorded, it's better to use the character names for clarity.
