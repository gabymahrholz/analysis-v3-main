You need both components for this course.\n\nIf this is not ringing any bells yet, have a quick browse through the [materials from year 1](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#sec-intro-r){target=\"_blank\"}to refresh yopur memory.\n\n### R server\n\nR and RStudio are already installed on the *R server*. We recommend using the server if your computer does not allow installation (e.g., a Chromebook), or if you have problems with installing R on your computer. Otherwise, you should consider installing R and RStudio on your own computer.\n\nYou will find the link to the server on Moodle.\n\n### Installing R and RStudio on your computer\n\n@sec-installing-r has detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your own computer. There are also some links to a series of walkthroughs for installing R on different types of computers/ operating systems.\n\nIf you had R and RStudio installed on your own computer last year, we recommend updating to the latest versions. In fact, it might be good to do that at the start of each academic year. Detailed guidance can be found in @sec-updating-r.\n\nOnce you have installed/updated R and RStudio, come back to this chapter.\n\n### Settings for Reproducibility\n\nYou should be doing things reproducibly, so that others (and your future self) can understand and check your work. That also allows you to reuse your work more easily.\n\nYou should always start with a clear workspace. Keeping anything in your Environment from a previous session means you can never be sure whether your current code is working or if your code is accessing a previously created object.\n\nHence, there are a few settings you should fix immediately after installing/updating RStudio, in <if>Tools \\> Global Options... General tab</if>\n\n-   uncheck the box that says <if>Restore .RData into workspace at startup</if> to make sure no data from a previous session is loaded into the environment\n-   set <if>Save workspace to .RData on exit</if> to <if>Never</if> so that your workspace is not saved when you exit RStudio.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Reproducibility settings](images/rstudio_settings_reproducibility.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RStudio panes\n\nRStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:\n\n-   Source pane\n-   Environment pane\n-   Console pane\n-   Output pane\n\n**Do you remember what their purpose is?**\n\n**The Source pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_XIGDABDKJI'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_XIGDABDKJI\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_XIGDABDKJI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_XIGDABDKJI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_XIGDABDKJI\" value=\"\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**The Environment pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_AGHCDVLSYE'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGHCDVLSYE\" value=\"\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGHCDVLSYE\" value=\"\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGHCDVLSYE\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AGHCDVLSYE\" value=\"\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**The Console pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_UIOYJIBKYL'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_UIOYJIBKYL\" value=\"\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_UIOYJIBKYL\" value=\"\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_UIOYJIBKYL\" value=\"\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_UIOYJIBKYL\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**The Output pane...** <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_DMDEVTIZFD'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DMDEVTIZFD\" value=\"\"></input> <span>allows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd files</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DMDEVTIZFD\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DMDEVTIZFD\" value=\"\"></input> <span>includes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search function</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_DMDEVTIZFD\" value=\"\"></input> <span>provides an area to interactively execute code</span></label></div>\n\n\n**Where are these panes located by default?**\n\n-   The Source pane is located?

If you want to know more about them, there is the [RStudio guide on posit](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n## Activity 1: Creating a new project\n\nIt's important that we create projects every time we start a new project. It makes life easier in terms of folder locations and working directories, basically keeping all the data and the RMarkdown documents in one location.\n\nLast year, you learnt how to create projects on the server, so you already know the steps. If cannot quite recall how that was done, go back to the [Level 1 materials](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#new-project){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nOn your own computer, open RStudio, and complete the following steps in this order:\n\n-   Click on <if>File \\> New Project...</if>\n-   Then, click on \"New Directory\"\n-   Then, click on \"New Project\"\n-   Name the directory something useful (e.g., \"2A_chapter1\"), and save it in a location that makes sense, for example a dedicated folder you have for your level 2 Psychology labs - you can either select a folder you have already in place, or create a new one (e.g., I named my new folder \"Level 2 labs\")\n-   Click \"Create Project\". RStudio will restart itself and open with this new project directory as the working directory.\n-   You can also check in your folder structure that everything was created as intended\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Creating a new project](images/project_setup.gif){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Why is the Colour scheme in the gif different?\" collapse=\"true\"}\nIn case anyone is wondering why my colour scheme in the gif above looks different to yours, I've set mine to \"Pastel On Dark\" in <if>Tools \\> Global Options... \\> Appearances</if>.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\n## Don't nest projects\n\nDon't ever save a new project **inside** another project directory. This can cause some hard-to-resolve problems.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Activity 2: Data for this chapter\n\n## R Markdown basics\n\n### Creating an R Markdown file\n\ndelete everything after the knitting part from line 12\n\nand save it in the project. All of the data files you need, should go into the same project folder too\n\n### Code Chunks vs Text\n\n### Knitting\n\n## Data Wrangling\n\nThe basic ones are the **Wickham 6** that you've encountered already last year\n\ntable of the Wickham 6 refer them back to the different chapters where they encountered it in level 1\n\n| Function    | Description                                                | Chapter                        |\n|:-----------------|:----------------------------------|:------------------|\n| select()    | Include or exclude certain variables (columns)             | add links to final L1 chapters |\n| filter()    | Include or exclude certain observations/data (rows)        |                                |\n| mutate()    | Creates new variables (columns)                            |                                |\n| arrange()   | Changes the order of observations (rows)                   |                                |\n| group_by()  | Organises the observations (rows) into groups              |                                |\n| summarise() | Create summary variables for groups of observations (rows) |                                |\n\n### Brief recap of the Wickham 6\n\n#### select\n\nMassive dataframes use a lot of computing power - to reduce that, it would be worth focussing on the columns you need\n\nselecting variables - you can rename them too if you don't like the column name as is\n\nif you wanna rename something at a later stage, use rename. Works in the same manner as select as in new name = old name. --\\> This could be in an information box\n\ndeselecting deselecting multiple variables\n\n#### filter\n\ntext - one condition vs more than one condition numbers - smaller/ larger\n\n#### arrange\n\nascending, descending - NAs will always listed at the end regardless\n\n#### mutate\n\nAllison's drawing\n\n#### group_by & summarise\n\n## Other useful functions\n\n### count\n\n### joining things together from separate datasets\n\n**inner_join**\n\n**full_join**\n\nUse the 2 chopped up tables earlier and merge them. They have no values overlapping, so it's difficult\n\n## Tidy data\n\n### pivoting data\n\npivot_wider and pivot_longer\n\n### recode\n\n### case_when\n\nAllison's drawing\n\n## [Pair-coding in the lab]{style=\"color: #EBA347; text-transform: uppercase;\"} {.unnumbered}\n\n## [Test your knowledge and challenge yourself]{style=\"color: #EBA347; text-transform: uppercase;\"} {.unnumbered}\n\nor for the Wickham 6 part, we could just go here is some data, lets apply them all.\n\nActivity 1: selecting specific columns First of all, we want to select the relevant columns\n",
