See @sec-project if you need some guidance.\n\n## Activity 2: Download the data\n\n* Download the data: link\n* Talk about the files\n* insert citation and abstract of the data\n* Look at the codebook and the variables\n\n\n## Activity 3: Load in the library, read in the data and familiarise yourself with the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Activity 4: Data Wrangling\n\nBefore we can do anything, we need to clean up the data. The data file looks pretty good, but the demographics could do with a bit of tidying. There are values and numeric categories in the same columns, suggesting some values have already been recoded whereas others have not. This is causing problems later on, better to tidy that.\n\nI have started tidying the dataframe, but something is not quite right. Find the sources for the errors \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalter_demo <- read_csv(\"Alter_2024_demographics.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(RaceEthE2 = case_match(RaceEthE,\n                               1 ~ \"Black/African American\",\n                               2 ~ \"Hispanic/Other Latinx\",\n                               3 ~ \"White\",\n                               4 ~ \"Multiracial\",\n                               5 ~ \"Asian/Pacific Islander\",\n                               6 ~ \"Native American/Alaska Native\",\n                               7 ~ \"South/Central American\",\n                               .default = NA\n  ),\n  GradeE2 = case_match(GradeE, # maybe keep the original\n                       \"1\" ~ \"A\",\n                       \"2\" ~ \"B\",\n                       \"3\" ~ \"C\",\n                       \"4\" ~ \"D\",\n                       \"5\" ~ \"F\",\n                       .default = GradeE),\n  StuStaE2 = case_when(\n    StuStaE %in% c(\"1\", \"Freshman\") ~ \"Freshman\",\n    StuStaE %in% c(\"2\", \"Sophomore\") ~ \"Sophomore\",\n    StuStaE %in% c(\"3\", \"Junior\") ~ \"Junior\",\n    StuStaE %in% c(\"4\", \"senior\", \"Senior\", \"post-bac\") ~ \"Senior or Higher\",\n                        .default = StuStaE),\n  MajorE2 = case_when(\n    MajorE %in% c(\"1\", \"Psych\", \"psych\", \"Psych B.S\", \"psychology\", \"Psychology\", \"psychology b.s\", \"Psychology B.S.\") ~ \"Psychology\",\n    MajorE %in% c(\"2\", \"Health Promotion\", \"Health Science\", \"Health Sciences\", \"health studies\", \"Health studies\", \"Health Studies\", \"PharmD\", \"communicative disorders\") ~ \"Health Studies\",\t\n    MajorE %in% c(\"3\", \"Kiniseology\") ~ \"Kinesiology\",\t\n    MajorE %in% c(\"4\", \"Psychology, hdf, Spanish\") ~ \"Double Major\",\t\n    MajorE %in% c(\"5\") ~ \"Political Science\",\t\n    MajorE %in% c(\"6\") ~ \"Computer Science\",\n    MajorE %in% c(\"7\") ~ \"HDF\",\n    MajorE %in% c(\"8\") ~ \"Accounting\",\t\n    MajorE %in% c(\"9\") ~ \"Economics\",\n    MajorE %in% c(\"10\") ~ \"PR\",\n    MajorE %in% c(\"11\") ~ \"Undeclared\",\n    MajorE %in% c(\"12\") ~ \"Mechanical Engineering\",\n    MajorE == \"n/a\" ~ NA,\n    str_detect(MajorE, \"and\") ~ \"Double Major\",\n    str_detect(MajorE, \"/\") ~ \"Double Major\",\n    str_detect(MajorE, \"&\") ~ \"Double Major\",\n    .default = MajorE\n  ))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Chi Square test {#sec-chi_square}\n\nis used when your variable is categorical\n\n\n\n\n## One-sample t-test {#sec-onesample}\n\nis used with a continuous variable\n\n",
