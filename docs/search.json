    "text": "Overview\nBook Name: Analysis\nSummary: Materials for the 2nd year undergraduate programme at the University of Glasgow, School of Psychology & Neuroscience.\nAuthors: CKT & GM. This version of the book is adapted from a previous version written by Phil McAleer, Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel, & Helena M. Paterson\nAim: This course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as probabilities, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. The most common statistical analyses are covered in this book such as t-test, correlations, ANOVAs, and regressions.\nNote: This book is currently being updated which means that chapters are being published on a rolling basis.\nContact: This book is a living document and will be regularly checked and updated for improvements. Should you have any issues using the book or queries, please contact Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel.\nR Version: This book has been written with R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt) (Race for Your Life) and RStudio version 2023.12.1+402 “Ocean Storm”.\nRandomising Seed: In chapters that use some level of randomisation, where we have remembered, the seed is set as 1409.\n\n\n In this book, we will help you learn a whole host of skills and methods based around being a psychologist. If you have completed the Data Skills book in the PsyTeachR series (https://psyteachr.github.io/) the first few chapters will be familiar to you, with some additions. This is deliberate in order to refresh your knowledge and skills before moving on to more advanced topics. First, we will remind you how to work with R Markdown, before recapping the main functions we use for visualisation and data wrangling. From there we will build your understanding of probability before going on to using all these refreshed skills to analyse a variety of different experiments. The main idea of this book is being reproducible in our data analysis approach.\nThis book requires a higher level of self-directed learning than the first book; part of learning is trying things out yourself and recognising where you need help. If you get stuck, google the problem or what you would like to do and see if that helps.\nWhen working through this book remember that this is not about learning a software. We do not teach R independent of statistical knowledge and content. Rather, we teach data and analytical skills and knowledge within R. The goal is to continuously improve your data analysis skills!\nYou can do this!"

    "text": "1.1 R and R Studio\nRemember, R is a programming language that you will write code in and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier as it’s more user friendly. You need both components for this course.\nIf this is not ringing any bells yet, have a quick browse through the materials from year 1to refresh yopur memory.\n\n1.1.1 R server\nR and RStudio are already installed on the R server. We recommend using the server if your computer does not allow installation (e.g., a Chromebook), or if you have problems with installing R on your computer. Otherwise, you should consider installing R and RStudio on your own computer.\nYou will find the link to the server on Moodle.\n\n1.1.2 Installing R and RStudio on your computer\nAppendix A has detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your own computer. There are also some links to a series of walkthroughs for installing R on different types of computers/ operating systems.\nIf you had R and RStudio installed on your own computer last year, we recommend updating to the latest versions. In fact, it might be good to do that at the start of each academic year. Detailed guidance can be found in Appendix B.\nOnce you have installed/updated R and RStudio, come back to this chapter.\n\n1.1.3 Settings for Reproducibility\n–&gt; mention the replication crisis, findings are not reproducible. Hence it’s super important that we do things in a reproducible way\nWikipedia: The replication crisis[a] is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method,[2] such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge.\nYou should be doing things reproducibly, so that others (and your future self) can understand and check your work. That also allows you to reuse your work more easily.\nYou should always start with a clear workspace. Keeping anything in your Environment from a previous session means you can never be sure whether your current code is working or if your code is accessing a previously created object.\nHence, there are a few settings you should fix immediately after installing/updating RStudio, in Tools &gt; Global Options… General tab\n\nuncheck the box that says Restore .RData into workspace at startup to make sure no data from a previous session is loaded into the environment\nset Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never so that your workspace is not saved when you exit RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility settings\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 RStudio panes\nRStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:\n\nSource pane\nEnvironment pane\nConsole pane\nOutput pane\n\nDo you remember what their purpose is?\nThe Source pane…\n\nallows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd filescontains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabsincludes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search functionprovides an area to interactively execute code\n\nThe Environment pane…\n\nallows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd filescontains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabsincludes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search functionprovides an area to interactively execute code\n\nThe Console pane…\n\nallows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd filescontains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabsincludes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search functionprovides an area to interactively execute code\n\nThe Output pane…\n\nallows users to view and edit various code-related files, such as .Rmd filescontains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabsincludes the Environment tab that displays currently saved objects, and the History tab that displays the commands that were executed in the current session along a search functionprovides an area to interactively execute code\n\nWhere are these panes located by default?\n\nThe Source pane is located? \ntop right\nbottom left\ntop left\nbottom right\n\nThe Environment pane is located? \nbottom left\ntop left\nbottom right\ntop right\n\nThe Console pane is located? \ntop right\ntop left\nbottom left\nbottom right\n\nThe Output pane is located? \ntop right\ntop left\nbottom right\nbottom left\n\n\nIf you were not quite sure about one/any of the panes, check out the materials from Level 1.

It makes life easier to work in multiple contexts, for example when analysing different datasets at the same time. Every RStudio project has their folder location, workspace, and working directories, basically keeping all the data and the RMarkdown documents in one location.\nLast year, you learnt how to create projects on the server, so you already know the steps. If cannot quite recall how that was done, go back to the Level 1 materials.\nOn your own computer, open RStudio, and complete the following steps in this order:\n\nClick on File &gt; New Project…\n\nThen, click on “New Directory”\nThen, click on “New Project”\nName the directory something useful (e.g., “2A_chapter1”), and save it in a location that makes sense, for example a dedicated folder you have for your level 2 Psychology labs - you can either select a folder you have already in place, or create a new one (e.g., I named my new folder “Level 2 labs”)\nClick “Create Project”. RStudio will restart itself and open with this new project directory as the working directory.\nYou can also check in your folder structure that everything was created as intended\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a new project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the Colour scheme in the gif different?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case anyone is wondering why my colour scheme in the gif above looks different to yours, I’ve set mine to “Pastel On Dark” in Tools &gt; Global Options… &gt; Appearances. And my computer lives in “dark mode”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t nest projects\n\n\n\nDon’t ever save a new project inside another project directory. This can cause some hard-to-resolve problems."

The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.\n\n# Load installr\nlibrary(installr)\n\n# Uninstall the problem package\nuninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\n# Then restart R using session - restart R\n# Then install the package fresh\n\ninstall.packages(\"package\")\n\n\nB.4.2 Cannot open file\nYou may get the following error after trying to install any packages at all:\n\nError in install packages : Cannot open file ‘C:/…..’: Permission denied\n\nThis usually indicates a permissions problem with writing to the default library (the folder that packages are kept in). Sometimes this means that you need to install R and RStudio as administrator or run it as administrator.\nOne other fix may be to change the library location using the following code (check in “C:/Program Files/R” for what version you should have instead of “R-3.5.2”):\n\n# change the library path\n.libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nIf that works and you can install packages, set this library path permanently:\n\nInstall the usethis package\nRun usethis::edit_r_profile() in the console; it will open up a blank file\nPaste into the file (your version of): .libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nSave and close the file\nRestart R for changes to take effect\n\nThe code in your .Rprofile will now run every time you start up R.\nAs always, if you’re having issues, please ask on Teams or come to office hours."

    "text": "How to cite R and RStudio\nYou may be some way off writing a scientific report where you have to cite and reference R, however, when the time comes it is important to do so to give the people who built it (most of them for free!) credit. You should provide separate citations for R, RStudio, and the packages you use.\nTo get the citation for the version of R you are using, simply run the citation() function which will always provide you with the most recent citation.\n\ncitation()\n\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2024). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  &lt;https://www.R-project.org/&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n\n\nTo generate the citation for any packages you are using, you can also use the citation() function with the name of the package you wish to cite.\n\ncitation(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo cite package 'tidyverse' in publications use:\n\n  Wickham H, Averick M, Bryan J, Chang W, McGowan LD, François R,\n  Grolemund G, Hayes A, Henry L, Hester J, Kuhn M, Pedersen TL, Miller\n  E, Bache SM, Müller K, Ooms J, Robinson D, Seidel DP, Spinu V,\n  Takahashi K, Vaughan D, Wilke C, Woo K, Yutani H (2019). \"Welcome to\n  the tidyverse.\" _Journal of Open Source Software_, *4*(43), 1686.\n  doi:10.21105/joss.01686 &lt;https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Article{,\n    title = {Welcome to the {tidyverse}},\n    author = {Hadley Wickham and Mara Averick and Jennifer Bryan and Winston Chang and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan and Romain François and Garrett Grolemund and Alex Hayes and Lionel Henry and Jim Hester and Max Kuhn and Thomas Lin Pedersen and Evan Miller and Stephan Milton Bache and Kirill Müller and Jeroen Ooms and David Robinson and Dana Paige Seidel and Vitalie Spinu and Kohske Takahashi and Davis Vaughan and Claus Wilke and Kara Woo and Hiroaki Yutani},\n    year = {2019},\n    journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n    volume = {4},\n    number = {43},\n    pages = {1686},\n    doi = {10.21105/joss.01686},\n  }\n\n\nTo generate the citation for the version of RStudio you are using, you can use the RStudio.Vesion() function:\n\nRStudio.Version()\n\nFinally, here’s an example of how that might look in the write-up of your method section:\n\nAnalysis was conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020), RStudio (Rstudio Team, 2020), and the tidyverse package (Wickham, 2017).\n\nAs noted, you may not have to do this for a while, but come back to this when you do because it’s important to give the open-source community credit for their work."
