    "text": "Overview\nBook Name: Analysis\nSummary: Materials for the 2nd year undergraduate programme at the University of Glasgow, School of Psychology & Neuroscience.\nAuthors: CKT & GM. This version of the book is adapted from a previous version written by Phil McAleer, Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel, & Helena M. Paterson\nAim: This course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as probabilities, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. The most common statistical analyses are covered in this book such as t-test, correlations, ANOVAs, and regressions.\nNote: This book is currently being updated which means that chapters are being published on a rolling basis.\nContact: This book is a living document and will be regularly checked and updated for improvements. Should you have any issues using the book or queries, please contact Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel.\nR Version: This book has been written with r R.version.string R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt).\nRandomising Seed: In chapters that use some level of randomisation, where we have remembered, the seed is set as 1409.\n\n\n In this book, we will help you learn a whole host of skills and methods based around being a psychologist. If you have completed the Data Skills book in the PsyTeachR series (https://psyteachr.github.io/) the first few chapters will be familiar to you, with some additions. This is deliberate in order to refresh your knowledge and skills before moving on to more advanced topics. First, we will remind you how to work with R Markdown, before recapping the main functions we use for visualisation and data wrangling. From there we will build your understanding of probability before going on to using all these refreshed skills to analyse a variety of different experiments. The main idea of this book is being reproducible in our data analysis approach.\nThis book requires a higher level of self-directed learning than the first book; part of learning is trying things out yourself and recognising where you need help. If you get stuck, google the problem or what you would like to do and see if that helps.\nWhen working through this book remember that this is not about learning a software. We do not teach R independent of statistical knowledge and content. Rather, we teach data and analytical skills and knowledge within R. The goal is to continuously improve your data analysis skills!\nYou can do this!"

    "text": "How to cite R and RStudio\nYou may be some way off writing a scientific report where you have to cite and reference R, however, when the time comes it is important to do so to give the people who built it (most of them for free!) credit. You should provide separate citations for R, RStudio, and the packages you use.\nTo get the citation for the version of R you are using, simply run the citation() function which will always provide you with the most recent citation.\n\ncitation()\n\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2024). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  &lt;https://www.R-project.org/&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n\n\nTo generate the citation for any packages you are using, you can also use the citation() function with the name of the package you wish to cite.\n\ncitation(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo cite package 'tidyverse' in publications use:\n\n  Wickham H, Averick M, Bryan J, Chang W, McGowan LD, François R,\n  Grolemund G, Hayes A, Henry L, Hester J, Kuhn M, Pedersen TL, Miller\n  E, Bache SM, Müller K, Ooms J, Robinson D, Seidel DP, Spinu V,\n  Takahashi K, Vaughan D, Wilke C, Woo K, Yutani H (2019). \"Welcome to\n  the tidyverse.\" _Journal of Open Source Software_, *4*(43), 1686.\n  doi:10.21105/joss.01686 &lt;https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Article{,\n    title = {Welcome to the {tidyverse}},\n    author = {Hadley Wickham and Mara Averick and Jennifer Bryan and Winston Chang and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan and Romain François and Garrett Grolemund and Alex Hayes and Lionel Henry and Jim Hester and Max Kuhn and Thomas Lin Pedersen and Evan Miller and Stephan Milton Bache and Kirill Müller and Jeroen Ooms and David Robinson and Dana Paige Seidel and Vitalie Spinu and Kohske Takahashi and Davis Vaughan and Claus Wilke and Kara Woo and Hiroaki Yutani},\n    year = {2019},\n    journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n    volume = {4},\n    number = {43},\n    pages = {1686},\n    doi = {10.21105/joss.01686},\n  }\n\n\nTo generate the citation for the version of RStudio you are using, you can use the RStudio.Vesion() function:\n\nRStudio.Version()\n\nFinally, here’s an example of how that might look in the write-up of your method section:\n\nAnalysis was conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020), RStudio (Rstudio Team, 2020), and the tidyverse package (Wickham, 2017).\n\nAs noted, you may not have to do this for a while, but come back to this when you do because it’s important to give the open-source community credit for their work."

If there are new unsaved changes, you will be able to click the icon.\nSelect the file you and to download in the files pane (bottom right) by ticking the box next to it, then click “More - Export” and save the file to your computer.\nIf you do not have R installed, DO NOT try to open it on your computer. If you do, it will open in Word, Endnote or similar, and it may corrupt your code. Only open the file if you have R and R Studio installed.\nIf you want to double check that this file is definitely the right one to submit for an assignment, you can re-upload it to the server and open it again to make sure it has the answers in it."

    "text": "B.3 Updating packages\nPackage developers will occasionally release updates to their packages. This is typically to add in new functions to the package, or to fix or amend existing functions. Be aware that some package updates may cause your previous code to stop working. This does not tend to happen with minor updates to packages, but occasionally with major updates, you can have serious issues if the developer has made fundamental changes to how the code works. For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) - don’t do it before an assessment or deadline just in case!\nTo update an individual package, the easiest way is to use the install.packages() function, as this always installs the most recent version of the package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo update multiple packages, or indeed all packages, RStudio provides helpful tools. Click Tools &gt; Check for Package Updates. A dialogue box will appear and you can select the packages you wish to update. Be aware that if you select all packages, this may take some time and you will be unable to use R whilst the process completes.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating packages with RStudio"

    "text": "B.4 Troubleshooting\nOccasionally, you might have a few problem packages that seemingly refuse to update. For me, rlang and vctrs cause me no end of trouble. These aren’t packages that you will likely every explicitly load, but they’re required beneath the surface for R to do things like knit your Markdown files etc.\n\nB.4.1 Non-zero exit status\nIf you try to update a package and get an error message that says something like Warning in install.packages : installation of package ‘vctrs’ had non-zero exit status or perhaps Error in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]) :  namespace 'rlang' 0.4.9 is being loaded, but &gt;= 0.4.10 is required one solution I have found is to manually uninstall the package, restart R, and then install the package new, rather than trying to update an existing version. The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.\n\n# Load installr\nlibrary(installr)\n\n# Uninstall the problem package\nuninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\n# Then restart R using session - restart R\n# Then install the package fresh\n\ninstall.packages(\"package\")\n\n\nB.4.2 Cannot open file\nYou may get the following error after trying to install any packages at all:\n\nError in install packages : Cannot open file ‘C:/…..’: Permission denied\n\nThis usually indicates a permissions problem with writing to the default library (the folder that packages are kept in). Sometimes this means that you need to install R and RStudio as administrator or run it as administrator.\nOne other fix may be to change the library location using the following code (check in “C:/Program Files/R” for what version you should have instead of “R-3.5.2”):\n\n# change the library path\n.libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nIf that works and you can install packages, set this library path permanently:\n\nInstall the usethis package\nRun usethis::edit_r_profile() in the console; it will open up a blank file\nPaste into the file (your version of): .libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nSave and close the file\nRestart R for changes to take effect\n\nThe code in your .Rprofile will now run every time you start up R.\nAs always, if you’re having issues, please ask on Teams or come to office hours."
