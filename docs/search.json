    "text": "Overview\nBook Name: Analysis\nSummary: Materials for the 2nd year undergraduate programme at the University of Glasgow, School of Psychology & Neuroscience.\nAuthors: CKT & GM. This version of the book is adapted from a previous version written by Phil McAleer, Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel, & Helena M. Paterson\nAim: This course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as probabilities, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. The most common statistical analyses are covered in this book such as t-test, correlations, ANOVAs, and regressions.\nNote: This book is currently being updated which means that chapters are being published on a rolling basis.\nContact: This book is a living document and will be regularly checked and updated for improvements. Should you have any issues using the book or queries, please contact Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel.\nR Version: This book has been written with R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt) (Race for Your Life) and RStudio version 2023.12.1+402 “Ocean Storm”.\nRandomising Seed: In chapters that use some level of randomisation, where we have remembered, the seed is set as 1409.\n\n\n In this book, we will help you learn a whole host of skills and methods based around being a psychologist. If you have completed the Data Skills book in the PsyTeachR series (https://psyteachr.github.io/) the first few chapters will be familiar to you, with some additions. This is deliberate in order to refresh your knowledge and skills before moving on to more advanced topics. First, we will remind you how to work with R Markdown, before recapping the main functions we use for visualisation and data wrangling. From there we will build your understanding of probability before going on to using all these refreshed skills to analyse a variety of different experiments. The main idea of this book is being reproducible in our data analysis approach.\nThis book requires a higher level of self-directed learning than the first book; part of learning is trying things out yourself and recognising where you need help. If you get stuck, google the problem or what you would like to do and see if that helps.\nWhen working through this book remember that this is not about learning a software. We do not teach R independent of statistical knowledge and content. Rather, we teach data and analytical skills and knowledge within R. The goal is to continuously improve your data analysis skills!\nYou can do this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n.callout-tip: Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n.callout-warning: Notes to warn you about something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n.callout-caution: Notes about things that could cause serious errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n.callout-important: Notes about things that are important."

    "text": "1.1 R and R Studio\nRemember, R is a programming language that you will write code in and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier as it’s more user friendly. You need both components for this course.\nIf this is not ringing any bells yet, have a quick browse through the materials from year 1 to refresh your memory.\n\n1.1.1 R server\nR and RStudio are already installed on the R server. We recommend using the server if your computer does not allow installation (e.g., a Chromebook), or if you have problems installing R on your computer. Otherwise, you should consider installing R and RStudio on your own computer.\nYou will find the link to the server on Moodle.\n\n1.1.2 Installing R and RStudio on your computer\nAppendix A has detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your own computer. There are also some links to a series of walkthroughs for installing R on different types of computers/ operating systems.\nIf you had R and RStudio installed on your own computer last year, we recommend updating to the latest versions. In fact, it might be good to do that at the start of each academic year. Detailed guidance can be found in Appendix B.\nOnce you have installed/updated R and RStudio, come back to this chapter.\n\n1.1.3 Settings for Reproducibility\n–&gt; mention the replication crisis, findings are not reproducible. Hence it’s super important that we do things in a reproducible way\nWikipedia: The replication crisis[a] is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method,[2] such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge.\nYou should be doing things reproducibly so that others (and your future self) can understand and check your work. That also allows you to reuse your work more easily.\nAlways start with a clear workspace. Keeping anything in your Global Environment from a previous session means you can never be sure whether your current code is working or if your code is accessing previously created objects.\nHence, there are a few settings you should fix immediately after installing/updating RStudio, in Tools &gt; Global Options… General tab\n\nuncheck the box that says Restore .RData into workspace at startup to make sure no data from a previous session is loaded into the environment\nset Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never so that your workspace is not saved when you exit RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility settings\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 RStudio panes\nRStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:\n\nSource pane\nEnvironment pane\nConsole pane\nOutput pane\n\nLets see what you remember about the RStudio panes from last year.

It makes life easier to work in multiple contexts, for example when analysing different datasets at the same time. Every RStudio project has their folder location, workspace, and working directories, basically keeping all the data and the RMarkdown documents in one location.\nLast year, you learnt how to create projects on the server, so you already know the steps. If cannot quite recall how that was done, go back to the Level 1 materials.\nOn your own computer, open RStudio, and complete the following steps in this order:\n\nClick on File &gt; New Project…\n\nThen, click on “New Directory”\nThen, click on “New Project”\nName the directory something meaningful (e.g., “2A_chapter1”), and save it in a location that makes sense, for example, a dedicated folder you have for your level 2 Psychology labs - you can either select a folder you have already in place, or create a new one (e.g., I named my new folder “Level 2 labs”)\nClick “Create Project”. RStudio will restart itself and open with this new project directory as the working directory. If you accidentally close it, you can open it by double-clicking on the project icon in your folder\nYou can also check in your folder structure that everything was created as intended\n\n\n\nCreating a new project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the Colour scheme in the gif different?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case anyone is wondering why my colour scheme in the gif above looks different to yours, I’ve set mine to “Pastel On Dark” in Tools &gt; Global Options… &gt; Appearances. And my computer lives in “dark mode”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t nest projects\n\n\n\nDon’t ever save a new project inside another project directory. This can cause some hard-to-resolve problems."

Male psychologists and female mathematicians: Gender beliefs and undergraduate degree choices. Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology, 34(2), e2784. https://doi.org/10.1002/casp.2784\n\nAbstract\n\nGlobally, men and women are numerically dominant in undergraduate degrees in math and psychology, respectively. A variety of theoretical perspectives predict that individuals who adhere more to gender stereotypes will be more represented in gender-dominant fields. Using a pre-registered methodology, we recruited men and women enrolled in psychology and math degree programmes in the United Kingdom and assessed a variety of gender beliefs and identities. Overall, femininity was (marginally) higher in psychology, and higher amongst women generally. Moderated regression analyses revealed that women who were low in masculinity and high in femininity (the stereotypical pattern) were most likely to be in psychology degrees, whilst women who were low in both were most likely to be enrolled onto math programmes. For men, no component of gender identity or beliefs predicted degree programmes. Overall, these results demonstrate how dimensions of gender identity may account for gender differences in undergraduate representation. Specifically, women in STEM fields tend to not describe themselves in stereotypical masculine or feminine traits. We discuss implications for efforts to increase uptake of gender stereotype incongruent career paths (e.g., women in STEM) with a particular focus on how femininity may be rejected in counter-stereotypical domains."

Doubles can have decimal places (e.g., 1.1). Integers are the whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, -1) and are displayed with the suffix L (e.g., 1L). This is not overly important but might leave you less puzzled the next time you see an L after a number.\nCharacters (also called “strings”) is anything written between quotation marks. This is usually text, but in special circumstances, a number can be a character if it placed within quotation marks. This can happen when you are recoding variables. It might not be too obvious at the time, but you won’t be able to calculate anything if the number is a character\n\n\nExample data types\nnumeric computation\ncharacter computation\n\n\n\n\ntypeof(1)\ntypeof(1L)\ntypeof(\"1\")\ntypeof(\"text\")\n\n[1] \"double\"\n[1] \"integer\"\n[1] \"character\"\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nNo problems here…\n\n1+1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\nWhen the data type is incorrect, you won’t be able to compute anything, despite your numbers being shown as numeric values in the dataframe. The error message tells you exactly what’s wrong with it, i.e., that you have non-numeric arguments.\n\n\"1\"+\"1\" # ERROR\n\nError in \"1\" + \"1\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical data (also sometimes called “Boolean” values) are one of two values: TRUE or FALSE (written in uppercase). They become really important when we use filter() (see ?sec-filter) or mutate() with conditional statements such as case_when() (see ?sec-conditional).\nSome commonly used logical operators:\n\n\noperator\ndescription\n\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n%in%\nTRUE if any element is in the following vector\n\n\n\nA factor is a specific type of integer or character that lets you assign the order of the categories. This becomes useful when you want to display certain categories in “the correct order” either in a dataframe (see arrange) or when plotting (see Chapter 3).\n\n1.6.2 Variable types\nYou’ve already encountered them in Level 1. Variables can be classified as continuous (numbers) or categorical (labels). It’s good to know the distinctions as it will help to decide the appropriate plot for your data (see Section 3.6).\nCategorical variables are properties you can count. They can be nominal, where the categories don’t have an order (e.g., gender) or ordinal (e.g., Likert scales either with numeric values 1-7 or with character labels such as “agree”, “neither agree nor disagree”, “disagree”). Categorical data may also be factors rather than characters.\nContinuous variables are properties you can measure and calculate sums/ means/ etc. They may be rounded to the nearest whole number, but it should make sense to have a value between them.

R prefers the data to be tidy, which means each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and the information in each cell is a single value.\nI’ve modified the data for today slightly, to build in some challenges that you would experience when dealing with raw data, but tbh, the data we are looking at today is pretty tidy.\nGetting an understanding of what your data currently looks like and being aware of what your data structure needs to be (e.g., for calculating descriptives, running inferential stats or plotting) is the first step of thinking about the processing steps of how to get your data from A to B."

Additionally, you can no longer use the values as numbers, such as calculating the mean.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nx &lt;- c(-3, 0, .5)  # numeric vector\nf &lt;- factor(x)     # convert to factor\nx == as.numeric(f) # does not convert back to numeric \n\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot average a factor\n\nm &lt;- mean(f)\n\n\nWarning in mean.default(f): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n\n\nSometimes people represent categorical variables with numbers that correspond to names, like 0 = “no” and 1 = “yes”, but values in between don’t have a clear interpretation. If you have control over how the data are recorded, it’s better to use the character names for clarity.

    "text": "3.3 Building plots\n\n3.3.1 \nThere are multiple approaches to data visualisation in R; in this course we will use the popular package ggplot2, which is part of the larger tidyverse collection of packages. A grammar of graphics (the “gg” in “ggplot”) is a standardised way to describe the components of a graphic. ggplot2 uses a layered grammar of graphics, in which plots are built up in a series of layers. It may be helpful to think about any picture as having multiple elements that sit semi-transparently over each other. A good analogy is old Disney movies where artists would create a background and then add moveable elements on top of the background via transparencies.\n?fig-layers displays the evolution of a simple scatterplot using this layered approach. First, the plot space is built (layer 1); the variables are specified (layer 2); the type of visualisation (known as a geom) that is desired for these variables is specified (layer 3) - in this case geom_point() is called to visualise individual data points; a second geom is added to include a line of best fit (layer 4), the axis labels are edited for readability (layer 5), and finally, a theme is applied to change the overall appearance of the plot (layer 6).\nImportantly, each layer is independent and independently customisable. For example, the size, colour and position of each component can be adjusted, or one could, for example, remove the first geom (the data points) to only visualise the line of best fit, simply by removing the layer that draws the data points (?fig-remove-layer). The use of layers makes it easy to build up complex plots step-by-step, and to adapt or extend plots from existing code."

Let’s use the pets data we loaded above. The second argument is the mapping for which columns in your data table correspond to which properties of the plot, such as the x-axis, the y-axis, line colour or linetype, point shape, or object fill. These mappings are specified by the aes() function. Just adding this to the ggplot function creates the labels and ranges for the x and y axes. They usually have sensible default values, given your data, but we’ll learn how to change them later.\n\nggplot(data = pets, mapping = aes(x = pet, y = score, colour = country, fill = country))\n\n\n\nEmpty ggplot with x and y labels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPeople usually omit the argument names and just put the aes() function directly as the second argument to ggplot. They also usually omit x and y as argument names to aes() (but you have to name the other properties).\n\n\n\n\nNext we can add “geoms”, or plot styles. You literally add them with the + symbol. You can customise the appearance of a geom with arguments like alpha (sets transparency).\n\nggplot(pets, aes(pet, score, colour = country, fill = country)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\nViolin plot with country represented by colour.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scale_* functions help you to customise the aesthetics.\n\nggplot(pets, aes(pet, score, colour = country, fill = country)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"orchid\")) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"orchid\"))\n\n\n\nCustomised colours.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther customise the image by setting the y-axis breaks and limits, and editing the labels.\n\nggplot(pets, aes(pet, score, colour = country, fill = country)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"orchid\")) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"orchid\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(50, 100, 150)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(50, 150)) +\n  labs(x = \"Pet type\",\n       y = \"Score on an Important Test\",\n       colour = \"Country of Origin\",\n       fill = \"Country of Origin\")\n\n\n\nCustomised axis labels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, change the theme and base font size and customise the legend position.\n\nggplot(pets, aes(pet, score, colour = country, fill = country)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"orchid\")) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"orchid\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(50, 100, 150)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(50, 150)) +\n  labs(x = \"Pet type\",\n       y = \"Score on an Important Test\",\n       colour = \"Country of Origin\",\n       fill = \"Country of Origin\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(legend.position = c(.83, .17))\n\nWarning: A numeric `legend.position` argument in `theme()` was deprecated in ggplot2\n3.5.0.\nℹ Please use the `legend.position.inside` argument of `theme()` instead.\n\n\n\n\nCustomised theme and legend position."

This also means that you never want to save your workspace when you exit, so set this to Never.

When you use the updateR() function, a series of dialogue boxes will appear.

This does not tend to happen with minor updates to packages, but occasionally with major updates, you can have serious issues if the developer has made fundamental changes to how the code works. For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) - don’t do it before an assessment or deadline just in case!\nTo update an individual package, the easiest way is to use the install.packages() function, as this always installs the most recent version of the package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo update multiple packages, or indeed all packages, RStudio provides helpful tools.

The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.\n\n# Load installr\nlibrary(installr)\n\n# Uninstall the problem package\nuninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\n# Then restart R using session - restart R\n# Then install the package fresh\n\ninstall.packages(\"package\")\n\n\nB.4.2 Cannot open file\nYou may get the following error after trying to install any packages at all:\n\nError in install packages : Cannot open file ‘C:/…..’: Permission denied\n\nThis usually indicates a permissions problem with writing to the default library (the folder that packages are kept in). Sometimes this means that you need to install R and RStudio as administrator or run it as administrator.\nOne other fix may be to change the library location using the following code (check in “C:/Program Files/R” for what version you should have instead of “R-3.5.2”):\n\n# change the library path\n.libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nIf that works and you can install packages, set this library path permanently:\n\nInstall the usethis package\nRun usethis::edit_r_profile() in the console; it will open up a blank file\nPaste into the file (your version of): .libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nSave and close the file\nRestart R for changes to take effect\n\nThe code in your .Rprofile will now run every time you start up R.\nAs always, if you’re having issues, please ask on Teams or come to office hours."
