    "text": "Overview\nBook Name: Analysis\nSummary: Materials for the 2nd year undergraduate programme at the University of Glasgow, School of Psychology & Neuroscience.\nAuthors: CKT & GM. This version of the book is adapted from a previous version written by Phil McAleer, Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel, & Helena M. Paterson\nAim: This course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as probabilities, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. The most common statistical analyses are covered in this book such as t-test, correlations, ANOVAs, and regressions.\nNote: This book is currently being updated which means that chapters are being published on a rolling basis.\nContact: This book is a living document and will be regularly checked and updated for improvements. Should you have any issues using the book or queries, please contact Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel.\nR Version: This book has been written with R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt) (Race for Your Life) and RStudio version 2023.12.1+402 “Ocean Storm”.\nRandomising Seed: In chapters that use some level of randomisation, where we have remembered, the seed is set as 1409.\n\n\n In this book, we will help you learn a whole host of skills and methods based around being a psychologist. If you have completed the Data Skills book in the PsyTeachR series (https://psyteachr.github.io/) the first few chapters will be familiar to you, with some additions. This is deliberate in order to refresh your knowledge and skills before moving on to more advanced topics. First, we will remind you how to work with R Markdown, before recapping the main functions we use for visualisation and data wrangling. From there we will build your understanding of probability before going on to using all these refreshed skills to analyse a variety of different experiments. The main idea of this book is being reproducible in our data analysis approach.\nThis book requires a higher level of self-directed learning than the first book; part of learning is trying things out yourself and recognising where you need help. If you get stuck, google the problem or what you would like to do and see if that helps.\nWhen working through this book remember that this is not about learning a software. We do not teach R independent of statistical knowledge and content. Rather, we teach data and analytical skills and knowledge within R. The goal is to continuously improve your data analysis skills!\nYou can do this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n.callout-tip: Tips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n.callout-warning: Notes to warn you about something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n.callout-caution: Notes about things that could cause serious errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n.callout-important: Notes about things that are important."

    "text": "1.1 R and R Studio\nRemember, R is a programming language that you will write code in and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier as it’s more user friendly. You need both components for this course.\nIf this is not ringing any bells yet, have a quick browse through the materials from year 1 to refresh your memory.\n\n1.1.1 R server\nR and RStudio are already installed on the R server. We recommend using the server if your computer does not allow installation (e.g., a Chromebook), or if you have problems installing R on your computer. Otherwise, you should consider installing R and RStudio on your own computer.\nYou will find the link to the server on Moodle.\n\n1.1.2 Installing R and RStudio on your computer\nAppendix A has detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio on your own computer. There are also some links to a series of walkthroughs for installing R on different types of computers/ operating systems.\nIf you had R and RStudio installed on your own computer last year, we recommend updating to the latest versions. In fact, it might be good to do that at the start of each academic year. Detailed guidance can be found in Appendix B.\nOnce you have installed/updated R and RStudio, come back to this chapter.\n\n1.1.3 Settings for Reproducibility\nBy now you should be aware that the Psychology department at the University of Glasgow is pretty big on reproducibility, open science, and raising students’ awareness about questionable research practices (QRPs) and how to avoid them. Therefore, you should be doing things reproducibly so that others (and your future self) can understand and check your work. That also allows you to reuse your work more easily.\nAlways start with a clear workspace. Keeping anything in your Global Environment from a previous session means you can never be sure whether your current code is working or if your code is accessing previously created objects.\nHence, there are a few settings you should fix immediately after installing/updating RStudio, in Tools &gt; Global Options… General tab\n\nuncheck the box that says Restore .RData into workspace at startup to make sure no data from a previous session is loaded into the environment\nset Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never so that your workspace is not saved when you exit RStudio.\n\n\n\nReproducibility settings in Global Ootions\n\n\n1.1.4 RStudio panes\nRStudio has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen:\n\nSource pane\nEnvironment pane\nConsole pane\nOutput pane\n\nLet’s see what you remember about the RStudio panes from last year.

    "text": "1.2 Activity 1: Creating a new project\nIt’s important that we create a new RStudio project every time we start a new project. It makes life easier to work in multiple contexts, for example when analysing different datasets at the same time. Every RStudio project has their folder location, workspace, and working directories, basically keeping all the data and the RMarkdown documents in one location.\nLast year, you learnt how to create projects on the server, so you already know the steps. If cannot quite recall how that was done, go back to the Level 1 materials.\nOn your own computer, open RStudio, and complete the following steps in this order:\n\nClick on File &gt; New Project…\n\nThen, click on “New Directory”\nThen, click on “New Project”\nName the directory something meaningful (e.g., “2A_chapter1”), and save it in a location that makes sense, for example, a dedicated folder you have for your level 2 Psychology labs - you can either select a folder you have already in place, or create a new one (e.g., I named my new folder “Level 2 labs”)\nClick “Create Project”. RStudio will restart itself and open with this new project directory as the working directory. If you accidentally close it, you can open it by double-clicking on the project icon in your folder\nYou can also check in your folder structure that everything was created as intended\n\n\n\nCreating a new project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the Colour scheme in the gif different?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case anyone is wondering why my colour scheme in the gif above looks different to yours, I’ve set mine to “Pastel On Dark” in Tools &gt; Global Options… &gt; Appearances. And my computer lives in “dark mode”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t nest projects\n\n\n\nDon’t ever save a new project inside another project directory. This can cause some hard-to-resolve problems."

    "section": "\n1.3 Activity 2: Create a new R Markdown file",
    "text": "1.3 Activity 2: Create a new R Markdown file\n\nOpen a new R Markdown document: click File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown or click on the little page icon with a green plus sign (top left).\nGive it a meaningful Title (e.g., Level 2 chapter 1) - you can also change the title later. Feel free to add your name or GUID in the Author field author name. Keep the Default Output Format as HTML.\nOnce the Rmd opened, you need to save the file.\nTo save it, click File &gt; Save As… or click on the little disc icon. Name it something meaningful (e.g., “chapter_01.Rmd”, “01_intro.Rmd”). Make sure there are no spaces in the name - R is not very fond of spaces… This file will automatically be saved in your project folder (i.e., your working directory) so you should now see this file appear in your file viewer pane.\n\n\n\nCreating a new Rmd file\n\nRemember, an R Markdown document or Rmd has “white space” (i.e., the markdown for formatted text) and “grey parts” (i.e., code chunks) in the default colour scheme (see Figure 1.1), and is a great way to create dynamic documents. The key advantage of R Markdown is that it allows you to write code into a document, along with regular text, and then knit it using the package knitr() to create your document as either a webpage (HTML), a PDF, or Word document (.docx). We’ll only knit to html documents in this course.\n\n\nR markdown anatomy (image from https://intro2r.com/r-markdown-anatomy.html)\n\n\n1.3.1 Markdown\nThe markdown space is for formatted text. You can and should write notes for yourself and others on what your code is doing (earlier on) or what decisions you are making. This can be really useful later on, for example, when making decision about inclusion/exclusion criteria or whatever you conclude from your assumption tests.\nThere is a variety of heading levels to make use of, using the # symbol.\n\n\nYou would incorporate this into your text as:\n# Heading level 1\n## Heading level 2\n### Heading level 3\n#### Heading level 4\n##### Heading level 5\n###### Heading level 6\n\n\nAnd it will be displayed in your knitted html file as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy heading levels don’t render properly when knitting\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need a space between the # and first letter. If the space is missing, the heading will be displayed in the html as …\n#Heading 1\n\n\n\nYou can also include unordered lists and ordered lists.\n\n\nunordered lists\nordered lists\nordered lists magic\n\n\n\nYou can add bullet points using either *, - or + and they will turn into:\n\nbullet point (created with *)\nbullet point (created with -)\nbullet point (created with +)\n\nor use bullet points of different levels using 1 tab key press or 2 spaces (for sub-item 1) or 2 tabs/4 spaces (for sub-sub-item 1):\n\nbullet point item 1\n\nsub-item 1\n\nsub-sub-item 1\nsub-sub-item 2\n\n\n\n\nbullet point item 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy bullet points don’t render properly when knitting\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need an empty row before your bullet points start. If I delete the empty row before the bullet points, they will be displayed in the html as …\nText without the empty row: * bullet point created with * - bullet point created with - + bullet point created with +\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the line with 1., 2., etc. When you want to include sub-items, either use the tab key twice or add 4 spaces. Same goes for the sub-sub-item: include either 2 tabs (or 4 manual spaces) from the last item or 4 tabs/ 8 spaces from the start of the line.\n\nlist item 1\nlist item 2\n\nsub-item 1 (with 4 spaces)\n\nsub-sub-item 1 (with an additional 4 spaces from the last indent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy list items don’t render properly when knitting\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t leave enough spaces, the list won’t be recognised and your output looks like this:\n\nlist item 3\n\n\nthis item has only 2 spaces A. this is an indent equivalent to 4 spaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe great thing though is that you don’t need to know your alphabet or number sequences. R markdown will fix that for you\nIf I type into my Rmd…\n\n…it will be rendered in the knitted html output as…\n\nlist item 3\nlist item 1\n\nsub-item labelled “a)”\nsub-item labelled “i)”\n\nsub-item labelled “C)”\nsub-item labelled “Z)”\n\n\n\n\nlist item 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe labels of the sub-items are not what I thought they would be. You said they are fixing themselves…\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, they do but you need to label your sub-item lists accordingly. The first label you list in each level is set as the baseline. If they are labelled 1) instead of i) or A., the output will show as follows, but the automatic-item-fixing still works:\n\nlist item 7\n\nlist item “1)” with 4 spaces\n\nlist item “1)” with 8 spaces\nthis is an item labelled “6)” (magically corrected to “2.”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude emphasis to draw attention to key words in your text:\n\n\nR markdown syntax\nDisplayed in the knitted html file\n\n\n\n**bold text**\nbold text\n\n\n*italic text*\nitalic text\n\n\n***bold and italic***\nbold and italic\n\n\n\nOther examples can be found in the R Markdown Cheat Sheet\n\n1.3.2 Code chunks\nEverything you write into the code chunks will be interpreted as code and computed by R. Code chunks start with ``` followed by an {r} which specifies the coding language, some space for code, and ends with ```. If you accidentally delete one of those backticks, your code won’t run and/or your text parts will be interpreted as part of the code chunks or vice versa. This should be evident from the colour change - more white than expected if it’s one of the starting backticks, and too much grey/not enough white when it’s the backticks at the end. But no need to fret - just add the missing backticks manually.\nYou can insert a new code chunk either by\n\nclicking the Insert a new code chunk button in the RStudio Toolbar (green icon at the top right corner of the Source pane)\nclicking on the menu Code &gt; Insert Chunk\n\nusing the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I for Windows and Cmd + Option + I on MacOSX or\ntyping ```{r} and ``` manually\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Default Rmd with highlighting - names in pink and knitr display options in purple\n\n\n\nWithin the curly brackets, you can specify a name for your code chunk (see pink highlighting in Figure 1.1). The chunk name is not necessarily required, however, it is good practice to give each chunk a unique name to support more advanced knitting approaches.\nWithin the the curly brackets, you can also place rules and arguments (see purple highlighting in Figure 1.1) to give you control over how your code is interpreted and what exactly is shown in your html output. The most common knitr display options are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nDoes code run\nDoes code show\nDo results show\n\n\n\neval=FALSE\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\necho=TRUE (default)\nYES\nYES\nYES\n\n\necho=FALSE\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nresults=“hide”\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\ninclude=FALSE\nYES\nNO\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe table above will be incredibly important for the data skills homework II.\n\n\n\nIn your newly created Rmd file, delete everything below line 12 (keep the set-up code chunk) and save your Rmd by clicking on the disc symbol.\n\n\n\nDelete everything below line 12"

Evaluating the Pedagogical Effectiveness of Study Preregistration in the Undergraduate Dissertation. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 6(4). https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459231202724\n\nAbstract\n\nResearch shows that questionable research practices (QRPs) are present in undergraduate final-year dissertation projects. One entry-level Open Science practice proposed to mitigate QRPs is “study preregistration,” through which researchers outline their research questions, design, method, and analysis plans before data collection and/or analysis. In this study, we aimed to empirically test the effectiveness of preregistration as a pedagogic tool in undergraduate dissertations using a quasi-experimental design. A total of 89 UK psychology students were recruited, including students who preregistered their empirical quantitative dissertation (n = 52; experimental group) and students who did not (n = 37; control group). Attitudes toward statistics, acceptance of QRPs, and perceived understanding of Open Science were measured both before and after dissertation completion. Exploratory measures included capability, opportunity, and motivation to engage with preregistration, measured at Time 1 only. This study was conducted as a Registered Report; Stage 1 protocol: https://osf.io/9hjbw (date of in-principle acceptance: September 21, 2021). Study preregistration did not significantly affect attitudes toward statistics or acceptance of QRPs. However, students who preregistered reported greater perceived understanding of Open Science concepts from Time 1 to Time 2 compared with students who did not preregister. Exploratory analyses indicated that students who preregistered reported significantly greater capability, opportunity, and motivation to preregister. Qualitative responses revealed that preregistration was perceived to improve clarity and organization of the dissertation, prevent QRPs, and promote rigor. Disadvantages and barriers included time, perceived rigidity, and need for training. These results contribute to discussions surrounding embedding Open Science principles into research training."

data type, such as numeric (numbers), character (text), and logical (TRUE/FALSE values), or a special class of factor.\nNumeric data can be double (dbl) or integer (int). Doubles can have decimal places (e.g., 1.1). Integers are the whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, -1) and are displayed with the suffix L (e.g., 1L). This is not overly important but might leave you less puzzled the next time you see an L after a number.\nCharacters (also called “strings”) is anything written between quotation marks. This is usually text, but in special circumstances, a number can be a character if it placed within quotation marks. This can happen when you are recoding variables. It might not be too obvious at the time, but you won’t be able to calculate anything if the number is a character\n\n\nExample data types\nnumeric computation\ncharacter computation\n\n\n\n\ntypeof(1)\ntypeof(1L)\ntypeof(\"1\")\ntypeof(\"text\")\n\n[1] \"double\"\n[1] \"integer\"\n[1] \"character\"\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nNo problems here…\n\n1+1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\nWhen the data type is incorrect, you won’t be able to compute anything, despite your numbers being shown as numeric values in the dataframe. The error message tells you exactly what’s wrong with it, i.e., that you have non-numeric arguments.\n\n\"1\"+\"1\" # ERROR\n\nError in \"1\" + \"1\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical data (also sometimes called “Boolean” values) are one of two values: TRUE or FALSE (written in uppercase). They become really important when we use filter() (see ?sec-filter) or mutate() with conditional statements such as case_when() (see ?sec-conditional).\nSome commonly used logical operators:\n\n\noperator\ndescription\n\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n%in%\nTRUE if any element is in the following vector\n\n\n\nA factor is a specific type of integer or character that lets you assign the order of the categories. This becomes useful when you want to display certain categories in “the correct order” either in a dataframe (see arrange) or when plotting (see Chapter 3).\n\n1.6.2 Variable types\nYou’ve already encountered them in Level 1 but let’s refresh. Variables can be classified as continuous (numbers) or categorical (labels).\nCategorical variables are properties you can count. They can be nominal, where the categories don’t have an order (e.g., gender) or ordinal (e.g., Likert scales either with numeric values 1-7 or with character labels such as “agree”, “neither agree nor disagree”, “disagree”). Categorical data may also be factors rather than characters.\nContinuous variables are properties you can measure and calculate sums/ means/ etc. They may be rounded to the nearest whole number, but it should make sense to have a value between them. Continuous variables always have a numeric data type (i.e. integer or double).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhy is this important you may ask? Knowing your variable and data types will help later on when deciding on an appropriate plot (Chapter 3) or which inferential test to run.\nIt’s good to know the distinctions as it will help to decide the appropriate plot for your data (see Section 3.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your understanding\n\n\n\nLet’s have a closer look at our data data_prp. For this little quiz, we’ve selected a few columns, shortened some of the column names, and modified some of the data types. This is the first few rows of the new object data_quiz. You can find the code with explanations at the end of this chapter (?sec-data-quiz).\n\nhead(data_quiz, n = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTime2_Code\nAge\nGender\nEthnicity\nSecondyeargrade\nQRP_item\nQRPs_mean\nCode == Time2_Code\n\n\n\nTr10\ntr10\n22\n2\nWhite European\n60-69% (2:1 grade)\n5\n5.909091\nFALSE\n\n\nBi07\nBi07\n20\n2\nWhite British\n50-59% (2:2 grade)\n2\n6.090909\nTRUE\n\n\nSK03\nSK03\n22\n2\nWhite British\n≥ 70% (1st class grade)\n6\n6.545454\nTRUE\n\n\nSM95\nSM95\n26\n2\nWhite British\n60-69% (2:1 grade)\n2\n5.272727\nTRUE\n\n\nSt01\nSt01\n22\n2\nWhite British\n60-69% (2:1 grade)\n6\n6.272727\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglimpse(data_quiz)\n\nRows: 89\nColumns: 9\n$ Code                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Tr10\", \"Bi07\", \"SK03\", \"SM95\", \"St01\", \"St10\", \"…\n$ Time2_Code           &lt;chr&gt; \"tr10\", \"Bi07\", \"SK03\", \"SM95\", \"St01\", \"St10\", \"…\n$ Age                  &lt;chr&gt; \"22\", \"20\", \"22\", \"26\", \"22\", \"20\", \"21\", \"21\", \"…\n$ Gender               &lt;fct&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2…\n$ Ethnicity            &lt;chr&gt; \"White European\", \"White British\", \"White British…\n$ Secondyeargrade      &lt;fct&gt; 60-69% (2:1 grade), 50-59% (2:2 grade), ≥ 70% (1s…\n$ QRP_item             &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 2, 6, 2, 6, 4, 6, 3, 7, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 3…\n$ QRPs_mean            &lt;dbl&gt; 5.909091, 6.090909, 6.545455, 5.272727, 6.272727,…\n$ `Code == Time2_Code` &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, …\n\n\nSelect from the dropdown menu the variable type and their data types for each of the columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn\nVariable type\nData type\n\n\n\nAge\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor\n\n\nGender\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor\n\n\nEthinicity\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor\n\n\nSecondyeargrade\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor\n\n\nQRP_item\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor\n\n\nQRPs_mean\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor\n\n\nCode == Time2_Code\n\ncontinuous\nnominal\nordinal\n\nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor"

Now that we named the new column Gender, R simply overwrites the existing column of the same name. If we had named the new column Gender_factor, we would have been able to retain the original Gender column and Gender_factor would have been added to the end\nline 4: There are a few things going on in line 4 (or 4-6 really)\n\nNote how line 3 had 2 opening brackets and only one of them was closing before the comma? This means we are still in the mutate() function.\nNow we are turning our variable Secondyeargrade into a factor. Spot the difference between this attempt and the one we used for Gender? Here we are using a lot more arguments in that factor function, namely levels and labels. Levels describes the unique values we have for that column, and in labels we want to define how these levels will be shown in the data object. If you don’t add the levels and labels argument, the labels will be the labels (as you can see in the Gender column in which we kept the numbers)\nAnd similar to Gender, we are replacing the “old” numeric Secondyeargrade with the new Secondyeargrade column that is now a factor\n\n\nline 7: Doesn’t seem to start with a function, which means we are still within the mutate() function - count the opening and closing brackets to confirm.\n\nHere, we are creating a new column called Code == Time2_Code. Notice the two backticks we have to use to make this weird column name work? This is because it has spaces (and we did mention that R doesn’t like spaces). So the backticks help R to group it as a unit/ a single name\nNext we have an ifelse() function which is a conditional statement. We are using it to check whether a conditional statement is TRUE or FALSE. Our conditional statement asks whether the Participant IDs that were collected at time point 1 (column Code) are exactly the same as in time point 2 (column Time2_Code). Notice how “Tr10” and “tr10” are not considered the same. We will come back to conditional statements in Chapter 2. But long story short, this Boolean expression created the logical data type in the dataset."

    "text": "3.1 Building pots\nWe are using the package ggplot2 to create data visualisations. It’s part of the tidyverse package. Actually, most people call th package ggplot but it’s official name is ggplot2.\n\n\nggplot2 uses a layered grammar of graphics, in which plots are built up in a series of layers. You would start with a base layer (opening ggplot), adding data and aesthetics, and selecting the geometries for plot.\nThese first 3 layers will give you the most simple version of a complete plot, but you could add other layers to make the plots pretty by using scales, facets, coordinates, labels and themes.\n\n\n\n\ngg layers (Presentation by Ryan Safner)\n\n\n\nTo give you a brief overview of the layering system, let’s use the package palmerpenguins (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). It contains data about bill length and depth, flipper length, and body mass, etc.\n\nhead(penguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.1\n18.7\n181\n3750\nmale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.5\n17.4\n186\n3800\nfemale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n40.3\n18.0\n195\n3250\nfemale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n36.7\n19.3\n193\n3450\nfemale\n2007\n\n\nAdelie\nTorgersen\n39.3\n20.6\n190\n3650\nmale\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s build a basic scatterplot to show the relationship between flipper_length and body_mass. We will customise plots further later on in the individual plots. This is just a quick overview of the different layers.\n\nLayer 1 creates a plot base to built up upon.\nLayer 2 adds the data and some aesthetics\n\ndata is first argument\naesthetics are added via the mapping argument. There you define your variables to be added (such as x, or x and y) and allows you specify overall properties like the colour of grouping variables etc.\n\n\nLayer 3 adds the geometries or geom_? for short. This tells ggplot in which style we want to plot the data points. Remember to add these layers with a + rather than a pipe %&gt;%. You can add multiple geoms if you wish, e.g., building a violin-boxplot\nLayer 4 adds the scale_? functions which can help you customise the aesthetics, such as changing colour. You can do much more with scales, but we’ll get to that later.\nLayer 5 introduces facets, such as facet_wrap() which allows you to add another dimension to the data output by showing the relationship you are interested in for each level of a categorical variable.\nLayer 6 - coordinates: coord_cartesian() controls the limits for the x- and y-axes (arguments xlim and ylim). Changing those allows you to zoom in or out of your plot.\nLayer 7 helps you to modify axes labels.\nLayer 8 controls the general style of a ggplot (e.g., background colour, size of text, borders, etc.). R comes with a few pre-defined ones (like theme_classic, theme_bw, theme_minimal, theme_light).\n\n\n\nLayer 1\nLayer 2\nLayer 3\nLayer 4\nLayer 5\nLayer 6\nLayer 7\nLayer 8\n\n\n\n\nggplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t see much here.

But we mapped in the aesthetics, that we want to plot variable body mass on the x-axis and flipper length on the y-axis. This also adds the axes titles and the values and break points of the axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou won’t need to add data = or mapping = if you keep those arguments in exactly that order. Likewise, the first column name you enter within the aes() function will always be interpreted as x, and the second as y, so you could omit them if you wish.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm))\n\nwill give you the same output as the code above.\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, colour=sex)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are telling ggplot that we want a scatterplot added.

Collabra: Psychology, 5(1), 31. https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.240\n\n‌\nAbstract\n\nThe Harry Potter series describes the adventures of a boy and his peers in a fictional world at the “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry”. In the series, pupils get appointed to one of four groups (Houses) at the beginning of their education based on their personality traits. The author of the books has constructed an online questionnaire that allows fans to find out their House affiliation. Crysel, Cook, Schember, and Webster (2015) argued that being sorted into a particular Hogwarts House through the Sorting Hat Quiz is related to empirically established personality traits. We replicated their study while improving on sample size, methods, and analysis. Although our results are similar, effect sizes are small overall, which attenuates the claims by Crysel et al. The effect vanishes when restricting the analysis to participants who desired, but were not sorted into a particular House. On a theoretical level, we extend previous research by also analysing the relation of the Hogwarts Houses to Schwartz’s Basic Human Values but find only moderate or no relations.\n\nChanges made to the dataset\n\nThe dataset is a reduced version of the original dataset.\nThe values in the IPIP 50 were turned into character responses\nAll reverse-coded items were already corrected in the original dataset, so we reversed that process.\nThe PVQ-RR has been revised repeatedly over the years (and is somewhat confusing tbh). To keep it simple, we opted to code the 57 items into a 12-value category structure as proposed by Giménez and Tamajón (2019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01797). This is not in line with Jakob et al. (2019), who used a 10-value categorisation approach."

    "text": "3.5 Activity 4: Data wrangling\nBefore we can plot anything, we need to get the data into the right shape.\nThe data for the questionnaires looks fairly complex. It’s best to split it up into separate data objects to wrangle the questionnaire data. The next sections will wrangle the data separately for the\n\nIPIP 50 - International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg et al., 2006)\nSD 3 - Short Dark Triad (Jones & Paulhus, 2013)\nPVQ-RR - Portrait Values Questionnaire (Schwartz et al., 2012).\n\n\n3.5.1 IPIP 50\nOverall goal is to compute a score for each of the personality dimension (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Intellect) for each participant. So how do we do this?\nFirst, check the data (data object and codebook). What is going on here? IPIP items are in data type \nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor and there is \nno\nsome reverse-scoring for the IPIP items.\nStep 1\nSelect the Participant id and the items of the IPIP.\n\nhp_ipip &lt;- hp_data %&gt;% \n  select(PP_ID, IPIP_01:IPIP_50)\n\nStep 2\nNext, items are in wide format which is not helpful. We need them in long format.\n\nhp_ipip &lt;- hp_ipip %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = -PP_ID, # all coloumns apart from PP_ID\n               names_to = \"IPIP_items\",\n               values_to = \"IPIP_response\") \n\nStep 3\nNow, we need information which items are reverse-coded and modify how they are scored. We could code this ourselves like we did in [LINK TO DATA SECTION IN CHAPTER 2], or we could take a shortcut since the information is already stored in the codebook.\nWe won’t need all the info from codebook, so we need to select the relevant columns (Questionnaire_Item, Forward- or Reverse-coded item, Dimension) first before joining our hp_ipip with codebook_reduced. Retaining the Dimension will help later on with calculating scores for each subscale.\nNotice how there are spaces in the variable name Forward- or Reverse-coded item which R has to wrap in single backticks to be able to process. Maybe better to change that variable name to FW_RV during selection so that it won’t give us a headache later on.\n\ncodebook_reduced &lt;- codebook %&gt;% \n  select(Questionnaire_Item, FW_RV = `Forward- or Reverse-coded item`, Dimension)\n\nNow we can join those 2 dataframes together using left_join() or an inner_join(), which means only information for the IPIP items will be considered.\n\nhp_ipip_codebook &lt;- left_join(hp_ipip, codebook_reduced)\n\nError in `left_join()`:\n! `by` must be supplied when `x` and `y` have no common variables.\nℹ Use `cross_join()` to perform a cross-join.\n\n\nOh, an error message. Meh. It says x and y have no common variables. Ohhh, because when we pivoted hp_ipip, we named the column with the IPIP items IPIP_items whereas information in codebook_reduced is stored in a column called Questionnaire_Item. To fix that, we could either\n\nchange the column name in hp_ipip during pivoting, i.e., setting names_to = \"Questionnaire_Item\"\n\nchange the column name in codebook_reduced during selection of the variables, i.e., select(IPIP_items = Questionnaire_Item, etc.) but that would only help us for IPIP items, not for the SD or the PVQ later on (so not really an option)\nuse a workaround and define the different column names in the “by” argument\n\n\nhp_ipip_codebook &lt;- left_join(hp_ipip, codebook_reduced, by = join_by(IPIP_items == Questionnaire_Item))\n\nglimpse(hp_ipip_codebook)\n\nRows: 49,400\nColumns: 5\n$ PP_ID         &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ IPIP_items    &lt;chr&gt; \"IPIP_01\", \"IPIP_02\", \"IPIP_03\", \"IPIP_04\", \"IPIP_05\", \"…\n$ IPIP_response &lt;chr&gt; \"moderately accurate\", \"very inaccurate\", \"moderately in…\n$ FW_RV         &lt;chr&gt; \"Forward\", \"Reverse\", \"Forward\", \"Reverse\", \"Forward\", \"…\n$ Dimension     &lt;chr&gt; \"Extraversion\", \"Agreeableness\", \"Conscientiousness\", \"E…\n\n\nStep 4\nNow it’s getting tricky. Reverse-coding.\nWhat we need to do is:\n\nturn the character values into numbers and\nmake sure that we the correct those numbers for the reverse-coded items\n\n\nhp_ipip_final &lt;- hp_ipip_codebook %&gt;% \n  # regardless of FW_RV item, we'll recode very inaccurate as 1, moderately inaccurate as 2, etc\n  mutate(IPIP_values = case_when(\n    IPIP_response == \"very inaccurate\" ~ 1,\n    IPIP_response == \"moderately inaccurate\" ~ 2,\n    IPIP_response == \"neither accurate nor inaccurate\" ~ 3,\n    IPIP_response == \"moderately accurate\" ~ 4,\n    IPIP_response == \"very accurate\" ~ 5,\n    .default = NA\n  )) %&gt;% \n  # now we are reverse-scoring items. If it's a reverse coded item, we want the corrected score be 6 minus the IPIP_value\n  mutate(IPIP_values_corrected = case_when(\n    FW_RV == \"Reverse\" ~ 6-IPIP_values,\n    .default = IPIP_values\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck it worked\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways good to double check to see if it worked. Either look at it, or create an output with distinct values.\n\ndistinct_values &lt;- hp_ipip_final %&gt;% \n  distinct(IPIP_response, FW_RV, IPIP_values_corrected) %&gt;% \n  arrange(FW_RV, desc(IPIP_values_corrected))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative solution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe took 2 steps above to turn character into numeric values and recode those according to whether they were reverse -scored. However, we could have done this in one step:\n\nhp_ipip_final_v2 &lt;- hp_ipip_codebook %&gt;% \n  mutate(IPIP_values_corrected = case_when(\n    IPIP_response == \"very inaccurate\" & FW_RV == \"Forward\" ~ 1,\n    IPIP_response == \"moderately inaccurate\" & FW_RV == \"Forward\" ~ 2,\n    IPIP_response == \"moderately accurate\" & FW_RV == \"Forward\" ~ 4,\n    IPIP_response == \"very accurate\" & FW_RV == \"Forward\" ~ 5,\n    IPIP_response == \"neither accurate nor inaccurate\" ~ 3, ## doesn't need to be recoded because 3 is 3 for both FW and RV items\n    IPIP_response == \"very inaccurate\" & FW_RV == \"Reverse\" ~ 5,\n    IPIP_response == \"moderately inaccurate\" & FW_RV == \"Reverse\" ~ 4,\n    IPIP_response == \"moderately accurate\" & FW_RV == \"Reverse\" ~ 2,\n    IPIP_response == \"very accurate\" & FW_RV == \"Reverse\" ~ 1,\n    .default = NA\n  ))\n\ndistinct_values_v2 &lt;- hp_ipip_final_v2 %&gt;% \n  distinct(IPIP_response, FW_RV, IPIP_values_corrected) %&gt;% \n  arrange(FW_RV, desc(IPIP_values_corrected))\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\nAccording to the paper, the IPIP scores are getting summed up for each of the dimensions. And we need to do this per participant.\n\nsummary_IPIP &lt;- hp_ipip_final %&gt;% \n  group_by(PP_ID, Dimension) %&gt;% \n  summarise(IPIP_score = sum(IPIP_values_corrected)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'PP_ID'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n3.5.2 SD3\nOverall goal for the SD3 questionnaire: We need to calculate an overall Score for the Dark Triad dimensions Psychopathy (lack of emotional warmth for others or empathy paired with sensation seeking, risk-taking behaviour, and lack of guilt), Machiavellianism (tendency to manipulate others for own gain), and Narcissism (exaggerated sense of grandiosity, importance, entitlement, and need to be admired) per participant.\nFirst, check the data (data object and codebook). What is going on here? SD items are in data type \nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor and there is \nno\nsome reverse-scoring for the SD items.\nSo how do we achieve that?  Actually the steps are fairly similar to what we computed for the IPIP, apart from having to recode the values as numbers before being able to reverse-code them:\n\nStep 1: select PP_ID and all the questions related to the SD_questionnaires\nStep 2: pivot into long format\nStep 3: join with codebook_reduced\n\nStep 4: reverse_code the scores\nStep 5: calculate sums for each dimension\n\nKeep to the separate steps if this is more organised for you easier to keep track, but we are attempting this in a single pipe. Keep the solution hidden if you want to challenge yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Wrangling code for SD3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary_SD &lt;- hp_data %&gt;% \n  select(PP_ID, starts_with(\"SD\")) %&gt;% # starts_with selects all column names that start with \"SD\"\n  pivot_longer(cols = -PP_ID, # all columns apart from PP_ID\n               names_to = \"Questionnaire_Item\", # smarter approach\n               values_to = \"SD_response\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(codebook_reduced) %&gt;% # now that the column names match across questionnaires, we don't need the by argument\n  mutate(SD_corrected = case_when(\n    FW_RV == \"Reverse\" ~ 6-SD_response,\n    .default = SD_response\n    )) %&gt;% \n  group_by(PP_ID, Dimension) %&gt;% \n  summarise(SD_score = sum(SD_corrected)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(Questionnaire_Item)`\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'PP_ID'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 PVQ-RR\nOverall goal for the PVQ-RR questionnaire: We need to calculate an overall score for each of the 12 dimensions per participant.\nFirst, check the data (data object and codebook). What is going on here? PVQ items are in data type \nnumeric\ncharacter\nlogical\nfactor and there is \nno\nsome reverse-scoring for the SD items.\nSo how do we achieve that?  Actually this is more straightforward than data wrangling for the IPIP and the SD. We basically have to:\n\nStep 1: select PP_ID and all the questions related to the PVQ_questionnaires\nStep 2: pivot into long format\nStep 3: join with codebook_reduced\n\nStep 4: calculate sums for each dimension\n\nSimilar to SD, we attempt this in a single pipe. Feel free to try first before looking at the solution below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Wrangling code for PVQ-RR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary_PVQ &lt;- hp_data %&gt;% \n  select(PP_ID, starts_with(\"PVQ\")) %&gt;% # starts_with selects all column names that start with \"PVQ\"\n  pivot_longer(cols = -PP_ID, # all columns apart from PP_ID\n               names_to = \"Questionnaire_Item\", # smarter approach\n               values_to = \"PVQ_response\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(codebook_reduced) %&gt;% # now that the column names match across questionnaires, we don't need the by argument\n  group_by(PP_ID, Dimension) %&gt;% \n  summarise(PVQ_score = mean(PVQ_response)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(Questionnaire_Item)`\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'PP_ID'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing though: The Dimension column has the name of the PVQ category but also the abbreviation in brackets. We might want to tidy that up now before we start plotting. We can use the separate() function for that.\n\nsummary_PVQ &lt;- summary_PVQ %&gt;% \n  separate(Dimension, into = c(\"Dimension\", NA), sep = \" \") # split column at the space character and keep Dimension and drop the second one (which would have been the abbreviation in brackets (XX))"

    "text": "3.6 Which plot shall I build???\nAlright, let’s get started with data visualisation, now that we have the data in a tidy format. Question is now, which one is the right plot for your data?\nDifferent types of data require different types of plots, so this comes back to how many variables are you aiming to plot and what kind of data type are they.\n\n3.6.1 One categorical variable\n\n3.6.1.1 Barplot (geom_bar())\nLet’s say we want to count some demographics. To keep it simple, we want to show gender counts. We would use a barplot for it. This is done with geom_bar() in your third layer, and because the counting is done in the background, the aes only requires an x value (i.e. the name of your variable).\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender)) +\n  geom_bar() \n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Base version of a barchart\n\n\n\nThis is the base plot done. You can customise it again by adding different layers. Some examples are in the tabs below.\n\n\nColour\nAxes labels & margins\nLegend\nThemes\n\n\n\nWe can change the colour by adding a fill argument in the aes(). If we want to modify these colours further, we would add a scale_fill_? argument. If you have specific colours in mind, you would use scale_fill_manual() or if you want to stick with pre-dined ones, like viridis, use scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  # customise colour\n  scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing too “off” in this case, but given Female and Male are capitalised, we may want to tidy the axes labels a bit. There is also this gap between bottom of the chart and the bars which seems a bit weird. We can remove that with an expansion() function.\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  # changing labels v1 (with labs function, can add x and y)\n  labs(x = \"Gender\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    # changing labels v2 (within the scale function, only deals with either x or y depending if it's scale_x or scale_y)\n    name = \"Count\",\n    # remove the space below the bars, but keep a tiny bit (5%) above\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legend does not add any information because the labels are already provided on the x axis. We can remove the legend by adding the argument guide = \"none\" into the scale_fill function.\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(\n    # remove the legend\n    guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Count\",\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s experiment with the themes. For this plot we have chosen theme_minimal()\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(\n    guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Count\",\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  # pick a theme\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.1.2 Column plot (geom_col())\nIf someone had already summarised those counts for you, you would not be able to use geom_bar(). In that case, you would switch to geom_col().\n\ngender_count &lt;- hp_data %&gt;% \n  count(gender)\n\ngender_count\n\n\n\n\ngender\nn\n\n\n\nFemale\n819\n\n\nMale\n169\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mapping for geom_col() requires both an x and a y aesthetics. In our example, x would be our categorical variable (e.g., gender), and y would be the column name that stored the values (n). Note how the base version has now n as an axis title (instead of count).\n\nggplot(gender_count, aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other layers to change the colour scheme, axes labels and margins, removing the legend and altering the theme are exactly the same. Test yourself to see if you could…\n\n\nchange the colour scheme (e.g., viridis or any other colour palettes)\n\nremove the legend\n\nchange the title of the x and y axes\n\nmake the bars start directly on the x axis\n\nadd a theme of your linking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode for the column plot with all other changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(gender_count, aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  # replaced vidiris with the brewer palette\n  scale_fill_brewer(\n    palette = \"Set1\",\n    guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Count\",\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  # different theme\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Two categorical variables\nThis time we want to know whether participants have already been sorted into their houses and what the gender splits are. To show that, we would need to produce a barchart that somehow includes multiple groups.\n\n3.6.2.1 Stacked barchart\nIf we are keeping to the base level plot and do not add any fancy arguments, we would create a Stacked barchart. As the name suggests, the subgroups are displayed on top of each other.\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = Sorting_completed_YN)) +\n  geom_bar() # position = \"stack\" is the default. Adding or removing this argument would produce the same plot\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Base version of a stacked barchart\n\n\n\nNow, the number of males in this sample are quite a bit lower than the number of females, which might make it tough to compare. Once way to get around this is to display a Percent stacked barchart.\n\n3.6.2.2 Percent stacked barchart\nWe will have to add the argument position = \"fill\" to the geom_bar(). By default, the position argument is set to “stack” so if we leave it out, we get the stacked barchart we produced above.\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = Sorting_completed_YN)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Base version of a percent stacked barchart\n\n\n\nNow we would be able to draw conclusions that a higher proportion of females in this sample have already completed the sorting compared to males.\n\n3.6.2.3 Grouped barchart\nOne more option would be to display the the bars next to each other rather than stacked in a Grouped barchart. We would achieve that by changing the position argument to “dogde”.\nWe could also move the legend to a different place by including the line theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") if you want it placed at the bottom of the plot (left, right (default), top, and bottom are possible).\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = Sorting_completed_YN)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  # legend moved below the plot\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Simple grouped barchart with legend position altered\n\n\n\nAgain, all other layers to change the colour of the bars, axes labels and margins, and altering the theme are exactly the same as we used in the barchart with one categorical variable. However, here the legend is meaningful, so we need to keep it.\nThe response labels “Yes” and “No” for variable “Sorting Completed” are pretty clear here, but if we wanted to change them, we can do that via the scale_fill_ function.\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = gender, fill = Sorting_completed_YN)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  # changing colour scheme to viridis\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(\n    # changing fill variable responses\n    labels = c(\"Not Yet Sorted\", \"Sorted\")\n  ) +\n  # changing labels for x, y, and fill\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Sorting Completed\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    # remove the space below the bars, but keep a tiny bit (5%) above\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  # pick a theme\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Grouped barchart with a few more layers added\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 One continuous variable\n\n3.6.3.1 Histogram geom_histogram()\n\nIf you wanted to show the distribution of a continuous variable, you can use a histogram. As with every plot, you need at least 3 layers to create a base version of the plot. Similar to geom_bar(), geom_histogram() only requires an x variable.\nA histogram splits the data into “bins” (i.e., groupings displayed in a single bar). These values are plotted along the x-axis and shows the count of how many observations are in each bin along the y-axis. It’s basically a bar chart for continuous variables.\nLet’s have a look at the age distribution in our dataset.\n\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) \n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwarning message\n\n\n\nThe warning message tell us that 2 rows were removed because they contained non-finite values outside the scale range. If you have a closer look at the data, you can spot those 2 rows as missing values.\n\n\nThe default bin number is 30. Changing the number of bins (argument bins) can help to show more or less fine tuning in the data. Bigger numbers of bins means more finetuning. Perhaps it’s more intuitive to modify the width of each bin instead via the argument (binwidth). The plots below show both.\n\n#less finetuning\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 10) \n\n# more fineturning\nggplot(hp_data, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) \n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_bin()`).\nRemoved 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Bins vs binwidth arguments\n\n\n\nadd some colour and a few layers\n\n3.6.4 One continuous and one categorical grouping variable\n\n3.6.4.1 \nHave one with char and one with numbers factors are important\ndodged histogram or better facet\nviolin plot\nboxplot\nviolin-boxplot\nFor ordinal rating scale: overplotting with geom_point.

For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) - don’t do it before an assessment or deadline just in case!\nTo update an individual package, the easiest way is to use the install.packages() function, as this always installs the most recent version of the package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo update multiple packages, or indeed all packages, RStudio provides helpful tools.

    "text": "B.4 Troubleshooting\nOccasionally, you might have a few problem packages that seemingly refuse to update. For me, rlang and vctrs cause me no end of trouble. These aren’t packages that you will likely every explicitly load, but they’re required beneath the surface for R to do things like knit your Markdown files etc.\n\nB.4.1 Non-zero exit status\nIf you try to update a package and get an error message that says something like Warning in install.packages : installation of package ‘vctrs’ had non-zero exit status or perhaps Error in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]) :  namespace 'rlang' 0.4.9 is being loaded, but &gt;= 0.4.10 is required one solution I have found is to manually uninstall the package, restart R, and then install the package new, rather than trying to update an existing version. The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.\n\n# Load installr\nlibrary(installr)\n\n# Uninstall the problem package\nuninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\n# Then restart R using session - restart R\n# Then install the package fresh\n\ninstall.packages(\"package\")\n\n\nB.4.2 Cannot open file\nYou may get the following error after trying to install any packages at all:\n\nError in install packages : Cannot open file ‘C:/…..’: Permission denied\n\nThis usually indicates a permissions problem with writing to the default library (the folder that packages are kept in). Sometimes this means that you need to install R and RStudio as administrator or run it as administrator.\nOne other fix may be to change the library location using the following code (check in “C:/Program Files/R” for what version you should have instead of “R-3.5.2”):\n\n# change the library path\n.libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nIf that works and you can install packages, set this library path permanently:\n\nInstall the usethis package\nRun usethis::edit_r_profile() in the console; it will open up a blank file\nPaste into the file (your version of): .libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nSave and close the file\nRestart R for changes to take effect\n\nThe code in your .Rprofile will now run every time you start up R.\nAs always, if you’re having issues, please ask on Teams or come to office hours."

Do this by clicking “File - Save”, Ctrl + S, or clicking the save icon. If all your changes have been saved, the save icon will be greyed out. If there are new unsaved changes, you will be able to click the icon.\nSelect the file you and to download in the files pane (bottom right) by ticking the box next to it, then click “More - Export” and save the file to your computer.\nIf you do not have R installed, DO NOT try to open it on your computer. If you do, it will open in Word, Endnote or similar, and it may corrupt your code. Only open the file if you have R and R Studio installed.\nIf you want to double check that this file is definitely the right one to submit for an assignment, you can re-upload it to the server and open it again to make sure it has the answers in it."

    "text": "How to cite R and RStudio\nYou may be some way off writing a scientific report where you have to cite and reference R, however, when the time comes it is important to do so to give the people who built it (most of them for free!) credit. You should provide separate citations for R, RStudio, and the packages you use.\nTo get the citation for the version of R you are using, simply run the citation() function which will always provide you with the most recent citation.\n\ncitation()\n\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2024). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  &lt;https://www.R-project.org/&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n\n\nTo generate the citation for any packages you are using, you can also use the citation() function with the name of the package you wish to cite.\n\ncitation(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo cite package 'tidyverse' in publications use:\n\n  Wickham H, Averick M, Bryan J, Chang W, McGowan LD, François R,\n  Grolemund G, Hayes A, Henry L, Hester J, Kuhn M, Pedersen TL, Miller\n  E, Bache SM, Müller K, Ooms J, Robinson D, Seidel DP, Spinu V,\n  Takahashi K, Vaughan D, Wilke C, Woo K, Yutani H (2019). \"Welcome to\n  the tidyverse.\" _Journal of Open Source Software_, *4*(43), 1686.\n  doi:10.21105/joss.01686 &lt;https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Article{,\n    title = {Welcome to the {tidyverse}},\n    author = {Hadley Wickham and Mara Averick and Jennifer Bryan and Winston Chang and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan and Romain François and Garrett Grolemund and Alex Hayes and Lionel Henry and Jim Hester and Max Kuhn and Thomas Lin Pedersen and Evan Miller and Stephan Milton Bache and Kirill Müller and Jeroen Ooms and David Robinson and Dana Paige Seidel and Vitalie Spinu and Kohske Takahashi and Davis Vaughan and Claus Wilke and Kara Woo and Hiroaki Yutani},\n    year = {2019},\n    journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n    volume = {4},\n    number = {43},\n    pages = {1686},\n    doi = {10.21105/joss.01686},\n  }\n\n\nTo generate the citation for the version of RStudio you are using, you can use the RStudio.Vesion() function:\n\nRStudio.Version()\n\nFinally, here’s an example of how that might look in the write-up of your method section:\n\nAnalysis was conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020), RStudio (Rstudio Team, 2020), and the tidyverse package (Wickham, 2017).\n\nAs noted, you may not have to do this for a while, but come back to this when you do because it’s important to give the open-source community credit for their work."
