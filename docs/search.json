    "text": "Overview\nBook Name: Analysis\nSummary: Materials for the 2nd year undergraduate programme at the University of Glasgow, School of Psychology & Neuroscience.\nAuthors: CKT & GM. This version of the book is adapted from a previous version written by Phil McAleer, Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel, & Helena M. Paterson\nAim: This course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as probabilities, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. The most common statistical analyses are covered in this book such as t-test, correlations, ANOVAs, and regressions.\nNote: This book is currently being updated which means that chapters are being published on a rolling basis.\nContact: This book is a living document and will be regularly checked and updated for improvements. Should you have any issues using the book or queries, please contact Carolina E. Kuepper-Tetzel.\nR Version: This book has been written with r R.version.string R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt).\nRandomising Seed: In chapters that use some level of randomisation, where we have remembered, the seed is set as 1409.\n\n\n In this book, we will help you learn a whole host of skills and methods based around being a psychologist. If you have completed the Data Skills book in the PsyTeachR series (https://psyteachr.github.io/) the first few chapters will be familiar to you, with some additions. This is deliberate in order to refresh your knowledge and skills before moving on to more advanced topics. First, we will remind you how to work with R Markdown, before recapping the main functions we use for visualisation and data wrangling. From there we will build your understanding of probability before going on to using all these refreshed skills to analyse a variety of different experiments. The main idea of this book is being reproducible in our data analysis approach.\nThis book requires a higher level of self-directed learning than the first book; part of learning is trying things out yourself and recognising where you need help. If you get stuck, google the problem or what you would like to do and see if that helps.\nWhen working through this book remember that this is not about learning a software. We do not teach R independent of statistical knowledge and content. Rather, we teach data and analytical skills and knowledge within R. The goal is to continuously improve your data analysis skills!\nYou can do this!"

Go to Global Options... under the Tools menu (⌘,), and in the General tab, uncheck the box that says Restore .RData into workspace at startup. If you keep things around in your workspace, things will get messy, and unexpected things will happen. You should always start with a clear workspace. This also means that you never want to save your workspace when you exit, so set this to Never. The only thing you want to save are your scripts.\nYou may also want to change the appearance of your code. Different fonts and themes can sometimes help with visual difficulties or dyslexia.\n\n\n\n\nRStudio General and Appearance settings\n\n\n\nYou may also want to change the settings in the Code tab.

When you use the updateR() function, a series of dialogue boxes will appear. These should be fairly self-explanatory but there is a full step-by-step guide available for how to use installr, the important bit is to select “Yes” when it asked if you would like to copy your packages from the older version of R.\n\n# Install the installr package\ninstall.packages(\"installr\")\n\n# Run the update function\ninstallR::updateR()\n\n\nB.2.2 Mac\nFor a Mac, you can use the updateR package.

This is typically to add in new functions to the package, or to fix or amend existing functions. Be aware that some package updates may cause your previous code to stop working. This does not tend to happen with minor updates to packages, but occasionally with major updates, you can have serious issues if the developer has made fundamental changes to how the code works. For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) - don’t do it before an assessment or deadline just in case!\nTo update an individual package, the easiest way is to use the install.packages() function, as this always installs the most recent version of the package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo update multiple packages, or indeed all packages, RStudio provides helpful tools. Click Tools &gt; Check for Package Updates. A dialogue box will appear and you can select the packages you wish to update.

    "text": "B.4 Troubleshooting\nOccasionally, you might have a few problem packages that seemingly refuse to update. For me, rlang and vctrs cause me no end of trouble. These aren’t packages that you will likely every explicitly load, but they’re required beneath the surface for R to do things like knit your Markdown files etc.\n\nB.4.1 Non-zero exit status\nIf you try to update a package and get an error message that says something like Warning in install.packages : installation of package ‘vctrs’ had non-zero exit status or perhaps Error in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]) :  namespace 'rlang' 0.4.9 is being loaded, but &gt;= 0.4.10 is required one solution I have found is to manually uninstall the package, restart R, and then install the package new, rather than trying to update an existing version. The installr package also has a useful function for uninstalling packages.\n\n# Load installr\nlibrary(installr)\n\n# Uninstall the problem package\nuninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n\n# Then restart R using session - restart R\n# Then install the package fresh\n\ninstall.packages(\"package\")\n\n\nB.4.2 Cannot open file\nYou may get the following error after trying to install any packages at all:\n\nError in install packages : Cannot open file ‘C:/…..’: Permission denied\n\nThis usually indicates a permissions problem with writing to the default library (the folder that packages are kept in). Sometimes this means that you need to install R and RStudio as administrator or run it as administrator.\nOne other fix may be to change the library location using the following code (check in “C:/Program Files/R” for what version you should have instead of “R-3.5.2”):\n\n# change the library path\n.libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nIf that works and you can install packages, set this library path permanently:\n\nInstall the usethis package\nRun usethis::edit_r_profile() in the console; it will open up a blank file\nPaste into the file (your version of): .libPaths(c(\"C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library\"))\n\nSave and close the file\nRestart R for changes to take effect\n\nThe code in your .Rprofile will now run every time you start up R.\nAs always, if you’re having issues, please ask on Teams or come to office hours."

R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  &lt;https://www.R-project.org/&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis.
