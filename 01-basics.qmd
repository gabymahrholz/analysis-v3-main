# Projects, R Markdown, and Data Wrangling

## Intended Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

-   Re-familiarise yourself with setting up projects
-   Re-familiarise yourself with RMarkdown documents
-   Recap and apply data wrangling procedures to analyse data

## [Individual Walkthrough]{style="color: #EBA347; text-transform: uppercase;"} {.unnumbered}

## Creating a new project

### own computer

Part 1 is how to set it up on your computer (with R and R Studio installed)

### Server

Part 2 is a link to book 1 if they are still working from the Server --\> https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/sec-intro.html?q=RMark#new-project

## R Markdown basics

### Creating an R Markdown file

delete everything after the knitting part from line 12

and save it in the project. All of the data files you need, should go into the same project folder too

### Code Chunks vs Text

### Knitting

## Data Wrangling

The basic ones are the **Wickham 6** that you've encountered already last year

table of the Wickham 6 refer them back to the different chapters where they encountered it in level 1

| Function    | Description                                                | Chapter                        |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------|:------------------|
| select()    | Include or exclude certain variables (columns)             | add links to final L1 chapters |
| filter()    | Include or exclude certain observations/data (rows)        |                                |
| mutate()    | Creates new variables (columns)                            |                                |
| arrange()   | Changes the order of observations (rows)                   |                                |
| group_by()  | Organises the observations (rows) into groups              |                                |
| summarise() | Create summary variables for groups of observations (rows) |                                |

### Brief recap of the Wickham 6

#### select

Massive dataframes use a lot of computing power - to reduce that, it would be worth focussing on the columns you need

selecting variables - you can rename them too if you don't like the column name as is

if you wanna rename something at a later stage, use rename. Works in the same manner as select as in new name = old name. --\> This could be in an information box

deselecting deselecting multiple variables

#### filter

text - one condition vs more than one condition numbers - smaller/ larger

#### arrange

ascending, descending - NAs will always listed at the end regardless

#### mutate

Allison's drawing

#### group_by & summarise

## Other useful functions

### count

### joining things together from separate datasets

**inner_join**

**full_join**

Use the 2 chopped up tables earlier and merge them. They have no values overlapping, so it's difficult

## Tidy data

### pivoting data

pivot_wider and pivot_longer

### recode

### case_when

or for the Wickham 6 part, we could just go here is some data, lets apply them all.

Activity 1: selecting specific columns First of all, we want to select the relevant columns
